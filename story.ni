Volume 1 - Pre-game setup

[the true point of the game is to help people come to grips with your personal death]

When play begins:
	say "Here it is: you finally found the right door. You turn the handle and step inside. Light filters in from the hallway and into the dark storage room, casting long shadows on the floor. 

You should be at the party right now. But you couldn't resist volunteering to find the Captain's ceremonial jacket; it gave you a chance to step away and be on your own, and you couldn't trust anyone else to find it.  After all, you're the only member of the ship to never have gone into cryogenic storage. You've walked the halls of this ship longer than anyone else.

This is the story of how you die."

Part 2 - Out of world actions

Abouting is an action out of world. Understand "About" as abouting. 

Carry out abouting:
	say "Never Gives Up Her Dead is a large-scale text adventure. For credits, type CREDITS[if the banquet-benches are shattered]. For a reminder on background information on the story, type BACKGROUND[end if].

The basic commands needed for this game include LOOK, INVENTORY, EXAMINE (or just X), TAKE, DROP, ENTER, N, E, S, W, UP, DOWN, OPEN, UNLOCK, PUSH, PULL, LOOK UNDER, TURN ON, TURN OFF, WAIT (or just Z), AGAIN (or just G). LOOK IN or SEARCH might occasionally be useful if you know items have been hidden on purpose.

This game is large, and you might acquire many things that cause disambiguation problems. Your rucksack can help you; by putting items in it and closing it, you can keep them hidden until needed. Just don't forget about them!

Conversation topics have their own inventory, found by typing TOPICS or T. When you receive new topics, they are currently in Brief mode, which prints only the name of new topics. By typing VERBOSE TOPICS, you can make all new topics print their name and content when you receive them. You can return to BRIEF mode with BRIEF TOPICS."

Backgrounding is an action out of world. Understand "background" as backgrounding.

Carry out backgrounding:
	say "You are Emrys Tisserand, a pioneer between the stars. You have left your comfortable retired life and grandchildren behind and embarked on a quest to establish a new colony. Your ship, the Starship Tragwyddol, has thousands of passengers in cold storage. For ten years you have entertained the crew with your tales while recording the ship's history. As Storyweaver, you keep the thread of history for the ship, to teach the past, record the present, and prepare others for the future. Most of the crew take turns in the cryochambers to lengthen their life span, but you, the heart of the ship, always intended this to be your last voyage. 

Storyweavers have the Gift, they say, and bring luck to everyone aboard. But now, only months away from your destination, your starship has suffered catastrophic damage from a collision with a comet.

This is the story of how you die. "

Helping is an action out of world. Understand "Help" as helping.

Carry out helping:
	say "The basic commands needed for this game include LOOK, INVENTORY, EXAMINE (or just X), TAKE, DROP, ENTER, N, E, S, W, UP, DOWN, OPEN, UNLOCK, PUSH, PULL, LOOK UNDER, TURN ON, TURN OFF, WAIT (or just Z), AGAIN (or just G). LOOK IN or SEARCH might occasionally be useful if you know items have been hidden on purpose.

Commands like UNDO, SAVE and RESTORE can be used to go back to earlier parts of the game.

Speech works by typing SAY [bracket]a topic[close bracket], or SAY [bracket]a topic[close bracket] TO [bracket]a person[close bracket]. Each topic can only be said to one person. All topics that are useful in the current region of the game you are in are listed in your topic inventory, accessible by typing TOPICS or T. To get all topics in all areas, type AT.

Conversation topics have their own inventory, found by typing TOPICS or T. When you receive new topics, they are currently in Brief mode, which prints only the name of new topics. By typing VERBOSE TOPICS, you can make all new topics print their name and content when you receive them. You can return to BRIEF mode with BRIEF TOPICS[if the player is in murder-region].

While solving the murder mystery, all clues are available as topics of conversation for all the suspects. You can LINK two clues that either contradict each other or support each other to get something you can confront the suspects with.

The special clue called Statement will transport you into a suspect's past when used. To leave early, type STOP[end if]."

[enable a mode where the preview of a topic is always printed when it is delivered?]

Crediting is an action out of world. Understand "Credits" as crediting. 

Carry out crediting:
	say "This game was written by Brian Rushton/Mathbrush using Inform 7 (by Graham Nelson). Beta testers include Amanda Walker, John Ziegler, Jade, Christopher Merriner, Patrick Mooney, Brett Witty, Rovarsson, E. Joyce, Max Fog, Dee Cooke, Ian Greener, Chandler Groover, Lance Cirone, Zed Lopez, Cody Gaisser, Alex Proudfoot, Radioactive Crow, Doug Egan, Mike Spivey, Larry Horsfield, Dirk Spivey, Arthur DiBianca, Hal Rushton, Hidnook, Charm Cochran, Grueslayer, Lynnea Glasser, Wade Clarke, Onno Brouwer, Mel Jason, Tabitha, Daniel Worm, Mike Russo, and Robert Eggleston, who was also the first to beat the full game. 

Hanon Ondricek gave helpful advice about the concept and title. Phil Riley and Peter Bates made suggestions about coding. Mike Russo and Garry Francis gave poetry tips. Wade Clarke and Mike Russo (again) gave some prose tips. otistdog provided helpful Inform 6 code.

Matt Weiner, N. Comier, Mike Sousa, Austin Auclair, Doug Egan, Pinkunz, and Charm Cochran served as inspiration for some puzzle content. Many of the standard Inform examples were used, but a lot of code was directly lifted from Under Contract, Example 205; Lethal Concentration 1 and 2, examples 255 and 257; Nickel and Dimed, example 262; Robo1 and Robo 2, examples 426 and 429; Entropy, example 182; The Cow Exonerated, example 401; In Fire or in Flood, example 401; Otranto, example 228.

Cover art was made from photographs by NASA and the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) and by Sandra Rushton, my mother.

This game is dedicated to Sean Shore and Marco Innocenti, who I used as my mental image of who the potential audience might be."
[Code from Otistdog was used for overly elaborate looking.]
[for testing]

After reading a command (this is the ignore beta-comments rule): 
	if the player's command exactly matches the regular expression "^<#*\p>(.*$)": 
		say "(Noted: '[text matching subexpression 1]')[line break]"; 
		reject the player's command. 

This is the calculator fixing rule:
	if something enterable (called the box) is enclosed by the location:
		now the noun is the box;
	otherwise:
		say "[bracket]If you are trying to enter a decimal on the calculator, you must add a zero before the period due to Inform's command processing.[close bracket][line break]";
		continue the activity.
 
The calculator fixing rule substitutes for the find what to enter rule when the busted-calculator is in the location.

[change description if you passed through it once]

Carry out going through a space-tear (called currenttear):
	if the currenttear is black-torn:

'You, like me, are a scholar, a historian. Storyweaver, what will they say about me if we fail? If the captain of the very first seedship loses it just a few small years from our goal?' he asks.

'You can't control what people say about you,' you answer. 'But you can control what you do.'

He shakes his head, then turns to look at his desk. He does not take notice of the gaping hole in spacetime next to it. But he notices the absence of his watch. He startles, then looks under the desk, but then notices you watching. He returns to sulking over his Scotch, now sadder than before."

'No, Captain, they're different--more like holes in space. I can enter them, go places...there's one in here, with us,' you say.

He looks around, seemingly not noticing the rift, then sighs and takes a heavy sip of his Scotch. 'I'm afraid I don't have time to deal with the metaphysical, Storyweaver. If there are such rifts, I suggest you find a way to make use of them, but, barring that... perhaps you should get some rest.'"

He looks at it for a moment, then says, 'This watch belongs to a long line of heroes. My ancestors won this in the first war, the one they called the Great War, before they had to resort to numbers. My grandfather had it, one of the first asteroid miners. My father had it, a heart surgeon who saved thousands. But I...I have no child to give it to. And I am not a hero.'

'That is your choice,' you say. 'No one can stop you. A true hero is anyone willing to risk himself to save his friends. If you're going to go down in history, make it be for something good.'

He stiffens and straightens up. 'You're right. Thank you, Storyweaver,' he says. 'I think it's time I helped out my crew.'

He gives you a nod, and walks out of the room.

The rift in this room gently turns from red to green, pulsing with energy.

Tiffany shoots out a bolt toward the guard in question, who ducks down.

'But second, notice that the leash is empty. A leash is used to control, to restrain. We are not restrained. This is not a prison ship; this is not a military vessel.

The main reason I was asked to remain on this ship for the last twenty years was to provide continuous documentation of our lives. While you might see me use the recorder to keep track of conversations or answer communications, its true purpose is to create and store long-term visual and auditory data. In a sense, I've become a living record of our people. And I couldn't have picked a better crew. Each of you has touched my life, and I hope that through my efforts, I can touch yours. Congratulations on twenty years!'

Lights click on, and you jump in surprise. You let out a shout when the lights reveal a pointed weapon only inches from your face. Then you realize that your attacker isn't moving. 

'A wax museum,' you say, breathily. Your dad used to take you to these when you were a kid. It was one of the things that got you to major in history in college, and it was also one of the reasons you wanted to be a Storyweaver. Although, you've never been in one alone before.

[only]You find yourself in a room dominated by two large wax figures. According to two helpful plaques, one is Napoleon, the would-be emperor of Europe. He has been depicted here riding a rearing horse, his cape billowing in the wind. He brandishes a well-polished saber in one hand.

The other figure is Khufu, the ancient Pharaoh of Egypt and possibly the architect of one of its grandest monuments. On one side of Khufu is a scale model of the Great Pyramid of Giza, although it seems slightly off-balance. On the other side is a gaudy version of the Sphinx[if currentcolor is not black].

Genghis Khan, meanwhile, is also reclining, with bandages wrapped around his chest. He seems fevered and in pain. Next to him is a low table[if the ridge-china is on khan-table] with [a ridge-china] on it[end if].

Contrasting with the gruesome deaths are several features reminiscent of an outdoor spa. One side of the room has a mud bath bubbling in the room. On another side is an actual running river (well, more of a creek), with plastic reeds planted nearby, presumably representing the Nile.

[A glass-box] is in the center of the room[if the sapphire-ring is in glass-box], holding a sapphire ring[otherwise], its ring now removed[end if].

One ring plain is put on show,[line break]
One ring buried deep below,[line break]
A ring marks each one’s royal end;[line break]
To their means of death attend.'

[brainstorming

collections of animals like rituals
animals like spells
use right item but possibly wrong location (each normal location has 3 animals)
rulebooks?
parser errors, scope, locale paragraphs, choosing notable locale objects
zookeeper's daily job (feeding, keeping animals alive. timing so they'll all be in different spots. like their schedule)
time of day? cycle of weather could be cool. Maybe even four seasons? could be a lot to write; 52 room descriptions! maybe not
either time of day OR weather
volcano: heat? what gets heated?
wasphawk bottle--evidence of humans? make this explicitly a zoo. 'Savanna' is down from an observation area.

As a zookeeper, you'll need to: keep animal enclosures clean, germ-free and safely secured. prepare food such as pellets, fresh produce, meat or hay and administer medications. observe animals and check for any signs of distress or ill health.

zookeeper tasks imply that there is a computer that can diagnose them, maybe? maybe have a food dispenser as well. examine droppings for hints of what they eat?

You can LURE one attuned animal at a time. To stop luring an animal, simply UNLURE.[roman type]"

Luring is an action applying to one thing. Understand "lure [something]" or "leash [something]" as luring when the animal-lure is enclosed by the player. Understand "lure [something]" or "leash [something]" as luring when the player is in ecocosm-region.

A zoo-animal can be lured or unlured. A zoo-animal is usually unlured.

	otherwise if the noun is not a zoo-animal:
		say "[The noun] [do] not respond, as the psychic leash is not attuned to [them]." instead;

A zoo-animal has a room called home-base. An animal can be predator or prey. An animal is usually prey.

Luredbeast is a zoo-animal that varies.

To return is a verb.

To say releasetext:
	if luredbeast was lured:
		say ". [The luredbeast], no longer targeted by the leash, [adapt the verb return] [if the location is home-base of luredbeast]back to [their] regular activities[otherwise]home[end if][predator-prey]";

		now the home-base of current is the location of current;
	now home-base of the desert-mice is mesa-room.
		
To stop is a verb.

Every turn when a zoo-animal is lured (this is the zoo following rule):
	if the player is not in ecocosm-region:

						now wanderer-wolf is good boy;
					otherwise if the location is unwolfseen:
						say "[The wanderer-wolf] follows you. He looks with great interest at his new environment[if the number of unlured zoo-animal in the location > 0], and sniffs [the list of unlured zoo-animal in the location][end if].";

'Oh, hello there,' you say, uncertain what to do.

The Curator pauses for a moment, the avatar peering at you, then says, 'You're not maintenance, are you? How did you get in here?'

'Uh...' you say, looking at the rift you came in by. 'It could be hard to explain.'

'Never mind,' says the Curator. 'I'll just run a scan on you in case I need to call the po--' A beep comes from the screen. 'Oh!' says the Curator. 'I just got your records. Hmm...very interesting!

'That seems pretty bad. Does that happen a lot around here?' you ask.

'No!' says the Curator. 'The drones aren't even supposed to be autonomous. They're meant for my own control. Anyway, the pieces are all there. If you gathered them and put them in the repair bay, I could fix the drone. Are you up to it?'

'Are the animals something I need to worry about?'

'No. I can apply a protective suit to you whenever you enter the zoo. And there should be a psychic leash around here somewhere--it will let you lead around the animals that are attuned to it. That should be enough to recover the drone's pieces.'

'Sounds good,' you say. 'How do I start?' 

The hatch opens, revealing a ladder[openhatch]. 'Down the hatch,' says the Curator."

Part of the wall slides open to reveal a glass holding cell[opencell]. Inside is Duke the dog, apparently asleep.

'Yeah, that's him. Is he alright? Why's he in that cell?' you ask.

'It's an automatic protocol,' says the Curator. 'When unauthorized animals are outside of the zoo proper, they're contained in holding cells.'

'Can you let him out?' you say.

'No, it requires manual override by a zookeeper drone. Which is exactly what I'd like your help with,' she says.".

Finally, the repair bay opens again, and a fully restored zookeeper drone appears!

'Thanks, Emrys,' says the Curator. 'What do you think of my real body?' She executes some aerial maneuvers.

'Very impressive,' you say diplomatically, although in truth she is not much better at controlling herself than the snake was. 'I enjoyed seeing your zoo. It's the largest one I've ever been to.'

'Oh, this is just the Aft Central Zoo,' says the robot. 'It's almost the smallest zoo in the whole ship!'";

'Clean? You guys been having problems recently?' you ask, worried.

'Just a virus going around. It's been rough, but it's getting better. He's good to go,' says the Curator. The cage opens. Duke wakes up, stretching. Then he notices you and the drone. Startled, he yelps and runs straight out into the rift.

You can hear a burst of happy noises from the other side[dukegone] of the rift that quickly fades.

'I guess this is it,' says the Curator. You nod. But she hovers closer. 

'Listen, Emrys,' she says. 'I've been talking with the others, about you. What you're doing. What the Pilot wants from you. I just want you to know that I understand.'

'What do you understand?' you ask.

'I can't tell you everything. I just want you to know that if you decide you don't accept your fate, I won't hold it against you.'

You go to ask more, but she holds up a finger and shakes her head.

'You should go. They're waiting for you. Good luck, Emrys.'";

The polar bear pushes it around from time to time, distracting himself from his hunger." The printed name of the fuel-storage is "fuel storage". Understand "fuel" or "storage" as the fuel-storage. The description of the fuel-storage is "This rather large drone piece is where its fuel is stored. Empty now, though.".

Before taking the fuel-storage when the polar-bear is not fed:
	say "The [polar-bear] is too busy playing around with [the fuel-storage] to let you near." instead;
	
After taking the fuel-storage for the first time:
	say "The polar bear, now sated, ignores you and allows you to take [the fuel-storage]."

While they are capable of killing most animals, they prefer to hunt seals and have been known to freeze the seal meat for later use."

Chapter 19 - Parkland

The parkland-room is west from savanna-room. The parkland-room is in ecocosm-region. The printed name of the parkland-room is "Parkland". The description of the parkland-room is "This part of the zoo is mostly flat, and has a mixture of aspen trees and fescue.

An informational sign is nestled beneath the leaves of the trees.".

Section 1 - Deer

The shedding-deer is a male zoo-animal in the parkland-room. Understand "deer" or "antler" or "antlers" as the shedding-deer. The printed name of the shedding-deer is "deer". The description of the shedding-deer is "This deer is an older specimen, with impressive antlers[if the bloody-velvet is part of the shedding-deer]. Those antlers, however, are currently shedding their velvet, giving them a gruesome and bloody appearance[otherwise], which are now completely clean[end if]."

The bloody-velvet is part of the shedding-deer. Understand "bloody" or "gruesome" or "blood" or "vessel" or "vessels" or "gore" or "gory" or "velvet" as the bloody-velvet. The printed name of the bloody-velvet is "velvet". The description of the bloody-velvet is "The velvet which covers the deer's antlers is peeling off in strips. It's a gory sight, as the blood vessels which were feeding it all have burst."

Instead of physicality when the noun is the bloody-velvet:
	say "The deer snorts and turns its head away."

Rule for writing a paragraph about the shedding-deer:
	unless the bloody-velvet is part of the shedding-deer:
		if the shedding-deer is lured:
			say "The deer follows you confidently, now that its horns are clean.";
		otherwise:
			say "The deer walks quietly through the woods.";
	otherwise:
		if a zoo-tree is in the location:
			if a croaking zoo-animal is in the location:
				say "The deer crouches in irritation, annoyed by the croaking frog. He makes no attempts to rub its antlers on the mossy trees.";
			otherwise:
				say "[A shedding-deer] is rubbing his antlers vigorously on [a random zoo-tree in the location] in an attempt to dislodge his bloody velvet, which is beginning to shed.";
		otherwise if the shedding-deer is lured:
			say "The deer is keeping close to you, although it seems irritated by the velvet on his head.";

Every turn when the shedding-deer is in the location:
	if the bloody-velvet is part of the shedding-deer:
		unless a croaking zoo-animal (called croaker) is in the location:
			if the player is in swamp-room:
				say "Without the annoyance of the frog, [the shedding-deer] heads to [the man-groves] and rubs his antlers against them, trying to scrape off the velvet. In the process, thick clumps of moss are scraped off the trees, falling to the ground.

	The deer's velvet is now completely rubbed off the antlers. It chews a few of the chunks, trying to recover lost nutrients, until the velvet is gone";
				now the moss-clumps are in swamp-room;
				now the bloody-velvet is nowhere;
				say ".";

After taking the moss-clumps for the first time:
	say "Taken. There's quite a lot of moss!"

Section 2 - Scenery

The aspen-trees are plural-named scenery zoo-trees in parkland-room. The printed name of the aspen-trees is "aspen trees".

The description of the fescue-grass is "This dry, yellow grass is fescue; you're only glad that you're visiting here when its not flowering, given your allergies."

Section 3 - Sign

The deer-sign is a zoo-sign in parkland-room. The sign-text of deer-sign is "deer". The description of the deer-sign is "Our deer may be hard to find this time of year. Some of them are going through deep biological changes. Throughout the summer, antlers grow from the males, covered and nurtured by a specialized layer of skin called velvet. In the fall, the velvet's blood flow is constricted, and the velvet begins to peel off.

To help this, the deer will scrape their antlers against trees, and some will even consume the velvet once it falls off. The scraping is so powerful it can sometimes strip bark or other covering off of trees."

Part 3 - Tool dimension

The tool-region is a region.

A scene-rift is a kind of thing. A scene-rift has a rift-style. A scene-rift has a room called the destination-room. A scene-rift can be enterable. A scene-rift is usually enterable. Understand "rift" as a scene-rift. Understand the rift-style property as describing a scene-rift.

Twinning relates a scene-rift to a scene-rift. The verb to twin means the twinning relation.

The rifted entering rule substitutes for the standard entering rule when entering a scene-rift.

This is the rifted entering rule:
	if the noun is not black-torn:
		say "[line break]***************************************************************************[line break]";
		say "You are engulfed in a [rift-style of the noun] haze, losing all sense of direction. Slowly the haze clears.";
		say "***************************************************************************[paragraph break]";
		now the player is in the destination-room of the noun;
	otherwise:
		say "You reach toward [the noun], but you are unable to touch it. The rift feels closed off.";
	
The standard report entering rule does nothing when entering a scene-rift.

Check an actor going (this is the can't go through closed rifts rule):
	if the door gone through is rifty:
		if the door gone through is open, continue the action;
		if the door gone through is wall-like and the location is hub-room:
			say "There's only a blank wall in that direction.";
			stop the action;
		otherwise:
			say "You try to enter [the door gone through], but it feels closed off, somehow.";
			stop the action.

The can't go through closed doors rule does nothing when going through a rifty door.

Chapter 1 - Main room

To say buttlist:
	say "[A list of visible pedestal-buttons] [are]"

Pedestal-text is some text that varies. Pedestal-text is "Welcome to Yang Labs! Your presence in this room indicates that you have been approved for the use of the portable Savoy Multitool, or are a hardened criminal willing to resort to desperate measures. Let's hope for the first one! Please ignore any sirens. 

Use of this tool without proper training is prohibited. Trainees will gain further access to features of the multi-tool by demonstrating their understanding of its current abilities. Training may include mental challenges appropriate for your level.

Your tool is currently restricted to its most limited ability: unlocking doors. Demonstrate your ability to use the tool by finding one of our several outposts, each marked with a door with an octagon symbol. Each of these outposts contains a crystal shard, a type of fuel source. Once you've obtained the shard, return to this room. 

Good luck, and thank you for visiting Yang Labs! When you're ready to upgrade your tool using a crystal shard, place one in the small hole which you can see in the pedestal."

A blue rift separates things in space only. An object introduced into one of the rifts will appear in the other, as you have seen.

Tiny blue rifts power the simple functions of the tool you have carried, allowing it to unlock mechanical locks or to transmit light from nearby sources.

We now introduce red rifts for you to experiment with. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, the distance between two events can be reffered to as space-like separation, time-like separation, or light-like separation. When two rifts that have space-like separation are connected, they glow blue from the energy. 

However, when two rifts that have time-like separation are connected, they glow with a color invisible to the naked eye, but which appears red to those with the Storyweaver gene. These red rifts create a kind of tension between the past and future; this tension can be called fate, or luck, or a temporal singularity. Once that tension is resolved, the energy level of the rifts increases dramatically, shifting their color to green.

Please take the next few minutes to wait and observe. You may diagnose the next rift whenever you want, once it has appeared. If you miss your window to diagnose the rift, you will have to repeat the calibration. Note that while you may see two rifts, there is only one rift, separated in time, as well as in space.";

This means time travel, and it is extraordinarily dangerous. Through painful experimentation, we have learned that changes to the time loop can cause a catastrophic restructuring of reality. Thus, there are only two circumstances in which the opening of red rifts is allowed:

First, red rifts can be experimented on inside a white rift or closed space, where it cannot affect the outer world. Timelines can and will collapse in such spaces, but that is what it is designed for, and is where your training will take place. 

Second, some rifts must be opened to protect the timeline. This happens when a rift is known to have been opened in the past; to maintain reality as we know it, we must ensure the creation of these rifts.

Almost all such past rifts have been accounted for. The only exceptions are a small number that are to be created by Emrys Tisserand. She is the only one who should be able to reach this part of training.

If you are reading this, Emrys: good luck. Place the tool on the pedestal to begin your next upgrade.";

As we mentioned last time, time loops can be unstable and collapse, leading them only to be used in controlled settings or pre-recorded historic moments.

However, careful testing has shown that two factors can make the time loops significantly more stable.

First, chaos and destruction at the past end of a rift can make a time traveller's actions have less effect on the future. For instance, cutting a famous painting could disrupt history, but not if done on the night the museum burns down.

Second, major life and death decisions cause less branches as reality converges to one or two options. A crashing airplane is so different from one that doesn't crash that minor differences often slip by, not disturbing time in any significant way.

These remaining upgrades were dictated for us by your recorded historical actions, Emrys. You will see unpleasant things. Place the tool on the pedestal when you are ready.";

He waves his hand. 'It's over for me. Don't worry, I knew this could happen. I thought it would be worth it to meet you. You saved my grandfather on the Starship Tragwyddol. All of us here, we owe our lives to you.'

You try to push the pillar, but it's fruitless. 'Come on,' you say to yourself, but it's completely futile.

He coughs again, weaker this time. 'If you find it, take it. The shards, the stabilizer, they're for you, Emrys. And your recorder...it's the key to so much. If only it didn't get damaged later on....'

You lean closer, and he shoves a paper into your hands. 'Take it,' he says. 'We tried to understand.... It's the best we could do. It's yours. You have to get the stabilizer.'

You nod. He smiles thinly.

From our previous research in the spherical chambers, we have learned that rifts are easier to form if there is a direct connection between the times and locations being opened, especially a causal connection. For instance, we had a sculptor create a clay figure. We moved the sculpture in spherical space, waited a week, then tried opening various rifts near the sculpture. By far the easiest rift to open was one to its original time and location of creation. Of course, this kind of experiment could only take place in spherical space.

We will upgrade your tool to take advantage of such synergies. It will take a great deal of energy to add on this new crystal shard, as the tool is close to reaching its limit. We will create a red rift to a momentous event, have you resolve it, and then, when it turns green, we will harvest the energy that has been generated.

Whether it was destiny or not, the people voted for me; this community wants me; and I realize more than ever that I have to preserve it. The anonymity of my role has given me an idea, and I intend to pursue it to its fullest, no matter what it costs. But if it works, it means my time is short. And so I'm spending a few weeks in the cabin. Mostly because the Record seems to require it, and partly because this place is where I feel most at home.

The cabin's aging, though. I've had to replace all but one of the stair beams, and that one will probably only last a few years. I've primed the sawmill, but I don't have the right wood for it; I need something seasoned. I've tried finding old logs in the forest but I haven't found any in the usual places; maybe I need to be more creative about where I look.

When I get back to work, we'll be starting trials with the new rift technology. It has to work, one way or another.[roman type]".

At first, I thought he was just going to return my sketchbook, because I left it in his shop. But he was so nervous when I opened the door. I was right, in a way; he had the sketchbook. But he said the Cents wanted to talk to me. 

Of course I freaked out after he left. The Cents? Did they think I was some kind of criminal? For what? Am I underage for the cabin? I asked the school about that specifically before I came out here.

I do not want to end up in prison in Central. I want to blame it all on Mr. Stevens. He said that he saw something in my sketchbook and had to send it in. So apparently my art is freaking someone out. He wouldn't tell me anything else, just mumbled something about the Record again and wandered off. 

I wonder what got them so upset. It was just some of my helmet designs--I've been working on skulls and spikes a lot recently. This one was all white, with a big cape behind. I don't get it.

I swear they just keep these cabins for the sake of unpaid labor, since somebody has to tend to all the repairs and the planting. But there's an old rumor about this cottage specifically; a lot of Storyweavers get sent here, mostly girls. They say it was Emrys's cottage, but that doesn't make sense, since she died long before this ship was made. I know they want something from me, from us, but I don't know what.

The simulated sky here is done very well. It looks just like Earth's sky does in the movies. It even tracks the moon and the sun correctly.

I've spent my time drawing, mostly. [roman type]

[bracket]Here there are several sketches of clothing, mostly outfits with lots of buckles and spikes, with one mask that looks a lot like a skull[close bracket][italic type]

I decided I was going to do it. To change something. I know by now that some of this journal will end up in the Record. So I decided to see if I even had the power to change things. To edit one page. A single sentence. Contradicting the Record just that little bit.

I knew it might change my past. It might erase me completely. But that's what they say, and how can I know that they're not just lying? Trying to manipulate me? Maybe they tell everyone these things; maybe every person I see in town is secretly being fed information from Central saying 'You're special. You're chosen. Your path is laid out'.

So I sat down to...I don't know. Try to change my future, and so to change my past. But I couldn't do it. My hand just started shaking. I began to panic. What, I thought, what if I had already changed it once? What if I was so lonely now because I had erased someone I loved from my actions? What if my life was so screwed up because I had ruined things already?

It was too much. I'm still shaking. I don't think I can go through with it.[roman type]".

He got a funny look on his face and told me it was in the record. I said, 'What record?' and he said, 'No, not just some record. The Record.' Don't know what he means by that. 

Had to oil the gate. I've been using oil for everything, so I've started growing flax in the garden. I comb it first then press it; it's convenient. I plan to grow flax pretty much forever, given how much oil I use. [roman type]

I've even made an outfit for myself based on that old drawing that got me into this mess in the first place. It's kind of warm--uncomfortably so--but I'll be wearing it more in Central than here. I'll use it during campaigning. I'm glad anonymity is mandated for candidates, although I don't know what they're going to do if I lose the election.

Speaking of which, that's coming up in a few months, and so I'll have to leave here. It'll be a long time before I can come back, but if I fixed this place up once, I can do it again. I have some ideas for the future; I think I can make some plaster out of mud and the cattail fluff. I'm excited to try it out![roman type]"

'Of course it's what I want,' says Positron, looking away. He stands up. 'Let's at least build a fire.' He grabs some matches and begins trying to light a heavy log.

'You can't burn that!' says Electron, laughing.

'What do you mean? Can't handle the smoke?'

'It's not that! You have to put something lighter, like this,' says Electron, putting some thinner wood onto the log. 'And some kindling,' she says, adding some paper. Her hands brush Positron's as she does so.

Spherical geometry: This geometry has constant curvature of 1 (or any positive number). A perfect sphere has this geometry. Such a space is finite.

Euclidean geometry: This geometry has constant curvature of 0. It is the geometry of a flat sheet of paper, and, in 3 dimensions, is essentially the geometry of the world as it appears on a human scale.

Hyperbolic geometry: This geometry has constant curvature of -1 (or any negative number). It is hard to describe, although it inspired authors like M.C. Escher. It can be modelled in two dimension by the surface of a saddle. It is by far the most common geometry, mathematically.[roman type]

It depicts hyperbolic space as a circle or disk with a small radius (such as a radius of 1).

It looks like there's more to read[or]Antonio Yang was able to recreate hyperbolic space in his early dimensional experiments, but of course in practice this involved paying careful attention to units.

Section 9 - Diffusion rules

A concentration is a kind of value. 20.99% specifies concentration. 20.99 % specifies concentration. 

A room has a concentration called current concentration. A room has a concentration called former concentration.

Equation - Upward pressure equation
	F1=F2+3(F3-F4)
where F1 is a number, guess is a number, F2 is a number, F3 is a number, F4 is a number. 

Equation - Downward pressure equation
	F1=F2+(F3-F4)
where F1 is a number, guess is a number, F2 is a number, F3 is a number, F4 is a number. 

To decide what number is the probability inverse between (space - a room) and (second space - a room): 
	let guess be 20;
	if elevation of space < elevation of second space:
		let F2 be guess;
		let F3 be elevation of second space;
		let F4 be elevation of space;
		let F1 be given by the Upward pressure equation;
		decide on F1;
	if elevation of space > elevation of second space:
		let F2 be guess;
		let F3 be elevation of second space;
		let F4 be elevation of space;
		let F1 be given by the Downward pressure equation;
		decide on F1;
	decide on guess. 

The diffusion rules are a rulebook. 

A diffusion rule (this is the gas movement rule):
	change the outside exit of east-wing to lib-office;
	change the inside exit of lib-office to east-wing;
	repeat with space running through rooms in alexandria-region: 
		let sum be 0.000 %; 
		repeat with way running through directions: 
			let barrier be the door way from the space;
			unless barrier is a closed door:
				let second space be the room way from the space;
				if second space is a room in alexandria-region: 
					let incoming be the former concentration of the second space divided by the probability inverse between second space and space; 
					let outgoing be the former concentration of the space divided by the probability inverse between space and second space; 
					let difference be incoming minus outgoing; 
					increase sum by the difference; 
		now current concentration of the space is the former concentration of the space plus the sum;
	change the outside exit of lower-lib to nothing;
	change the inside exit of lib-office to nothing;

A diffusion rule (this is the resetting concentration rule): 
	repeat with space running through rooms in alexandria-region: 
		now the former concentration of the space is the current concentration of the space. 

The last diffusion rule (this is the lethal dosage rule): 
	if the current concentration of the location is greater than LC50: 
		say "The gas is extremely thick in this room, almost overbearing. Fortunately your gas mask is working. "; 
	otherwise if the current concentration of the location is greater than TLV-STEL: 
		say "The gas is very concentrated here, but your gas mask is working well. ";
	otherwise if the current concentration of the location is greater than TLV:
		say "The gas is just strong enough in this room that you can see it beating back the mold. ";
	otherwise:
		say "There is some gas in this room, but it is only having a small effect on the mold at this concentration. ";
	if the player is in lib-dome:
		say "The sulfur dioxide is flowing down the ladder.";
	otherwise if the player is in upper-lib:

	otherwise if the player is in lib-office:
		say "The sulfur dioxide sinks down through the crack in the floor[if the office-door is open] and a bit out the door[otherwise]. None comes through the door[end if].";
	otherwise if the player is in lower-lib:
		say "Here, at the lowest part of the library, the sulfur dioxide pools the most, although a bit flows back to the rest of the library.";
	otherwise if the player is in east-wing:

Instead of going somewhere when the player encloses something (called the stolen goods) which is not owned by the player: 
	if the owner of the stolen goods is not a person: 
		now the player owns the stolen goods; 
		continue the action;

Rule for printing room description details of something (called target) which is for sale (this is the disclose prices in room description rule): say " ([price of the target])". 

Before listing contents: group money together giving articles. 

Report examining a for sale thing (this is the describe things by price rule):

The cashbox is a container. The cashbox contains 10 1-cent coins. The cashbox contains 10 5-cent coins. The cashbox contains 10 10-cent coins. The cashbox contains 10 20-cent coins. The cashbox contains 10 rysti bills. The cashbox contains 10 five-rysti bills. 

The block buying rule does nothing when the player is in monument-region.

	if the owner of the noun is nothing:
		say "That's not for sale." instead;
	otherwise:
		if the noun is not for sale, say "[The owner of the noun] does not want to sell you [the noun]." instead;

Carry out buying something: 
	let sum paid be ET0.00; 
	while sum paid is less than the price of the noun: 
		let current target be the price of the noun minus the sum paid; 
		let bill offered be the best money from the player for the current target; 
		if the bill offered is money: 
			move the bill offered to the owner of the noun; 
			now the bill offered is spent; 
			increase the sum paid by the price of the bill offered; 
			let current target be the price of the noun minus the sum paid; 
	say "You hand [the owner of the noun] [a list of spent money]. [run paragraph on]"; 
	let change be ET0.00; 
	if the sum paid is greater than the price of the noun: 
		now the change is the sum paid minus the price of the noun; 
	if change is greater than the sum in the cashbox: 
		now the player carries every spent money; 
		now every spent thing is fresh; 
		say "'Stop,' says [the owner of the noun], handing the cash back to you. 'I can't make change for that. You'll have to find more small bills.'" instead; 
	now every spent thing is in the cashbox; 
	now every spent thing is fresh; 
	while change is greater than ET0.00: 
		let change bill be the best money from the cashbox for change; 
		decrease change by the price of the change bill; 
		now change bill is spent; 
		move change bill to player; 
	if money is spent, say "[The owner of the noun] makes change with [a list of spent money]. [run paragraph on]"; 
	now every spent thing is fresh; 
	if the noun is not enclosed by the player and the owner of the noun can touch the noun: 
		say "'Enjoy your purchase,' says [the owner of the noun], handing [the noun] to you. [run paragraph on]"; 
		move the noun to the player; 
	now the player owns the noun;
	now the noun is not for sale;

Money can be spent or fresh. 

Report buying something: 
	if the player owns the noun, 
		say "Your transaction is now complete, leaving you with [the player's cash]." 

Definition: money is costly if its price is ET2.50 or more. Definition: money is cheap if its price is ET0.99 or less. 

Functional relation is a kind of value. The functional relations are overpayment, underpayment and irrelevant. Money has a functional relation. 

To decide what money is the best money from (buyer - a thing) for (cost - a price): 
	repeat with bill offered running through money: 
		if the bill offered is enclosed by the buyer: 
			if the price of the bill offered is the cost, decide on the bill offered; 
			if the price of the bill offered is greater than the cost, now the functional relation of bill offered is overpayment; 
			otherwise now the functional relation of the bill offered is underpayment; 
		otherwise: 
			now the functional relation of the bill offered is irrelevant; 
	[say "underpayment: [a list of underpayment money] 
	overpayment: [a list of overpayment money]";] 
	if the total price of underpayment money is less than the cost: 
		decide on the cheapest money which is overpayment; 
	otherwise: 
		decide on the costliest money which is underpayment. 

Instead of giving money to someone: 
	say "Best to keep transactions simple by buying whatever you want."

Section 1 - Equipment

[Most of this code is from Witnessed 1 and Witnessed 2]

A battery is a kind of thing. A battery has a number called charge. The charge of a battery is usually 15.

The em-battery is a battery.

Instead of giving a discharged battery to the shop-keeper:
	say "[The shop-keeper] takes the battery from you and swaps it with a fully charged battery.";
	now the charge of the noun is 15;

[change this to just when emf detector is on]
Every turn when a battery is enclosed by the location:
	repeat with hollow running through battery-compartments:
		if the hollow is part of a switched on batteried-device (called the machine):
			if a battery (called cell) is in the hollow:
				decrement the charge of the cell;
				carry out the warning about failure activity with the machine;
				if the cell is discharged, carry out the putting out activity with the machine;
			otherwise:
				carry out the putting out activity with the machine.

Warning about failure of something is an activity.

Rule for warning about failure of a batteried-device (called the machine):
	if a random battery-compartment which is part of the machine contains a battery (called the power source):
		if the charge of the power source is 2, say "[The machine] is obviously going to go out quite soon."

Instead of opening a batteried-device, try opening a random battery-compartment which is part of the noun. Instead of closing a batteried-device, try closing a random battery-compartment which is part of the noun. Instead of inserting a battery into a batteried-device, try inserting the noun into a random battery-compartment which is part of the second noun.

Instead of switching on an empty batteried-device:
	say "Nothing happens, perhaps because there isn't a charged battery in [the noun]."

Instead of switching on a battery-compartment which is part of a batteried-device (called the power user), try switching on the power user.

Definition: a batteried-device is empty:
	if a random battery-compartment which is part of it contains a battery (called the power source):
		if the power source is discharged, yes;
		no;
	yes.

[italic type]Requires one M battery[roman type].

Next to that are printed some guidelines[if the em-meter is switched on].

Currently it is reading at [meter-setting][end if]." 

The meter-guidelines are part of the em-meter. Understand "guidelines" or "guideline" as the meter-guidelines. The description of the meter-guidelines is "The guidelines on the [em-meter] say:

[italic type]This meter detects potential Yang Field spikes in machinery in the nearby area. It is not precise enough to specify where the spikes are located; instead, it counts all spikes in the current area and all adjacent areas. It can be used to predict where spikes will occur, and thus aid in the placement of field dampers. 

Field dampers only activate once the associated machinery is turned on. Therefore, this meter does not change in its readings even if the dampers have been placed in the correct location. Only attempting to use the machine can verify if placement is correct.

This device only lasts for around 15 minutes before it must be recharged.[roman type]"


Rule for warning about failure of the em-meter:
	if a random battery-compartment which is part of the em-meter contains a battery (called the power source):
		if the charge of the power source is 2, say "The display on [the em-meter] begins to flicker ominously."

Section 3 - Simple Burning

Understand the commands "light" and "burn" as something new.

Understand "burn [something] with [strikable-match]" as burning it with. Understand "burn [something] with [something preferably held]" as burning it with. Burning it with is an action applying to one thing and one carried thing.

Understand the command "light" as "burn".

A thing can be flammable or impervious. A thing is usually impervious.

Check burning something with something (this is the wrong place wrong time rule):
	if the player is not in monument-region:
		try burning the noun;

Check burning something with something (this is the burn only with flaming matches rule):
	if the second noun is not flaming, say "[The second noun] needs to be burning first." instead.

Check burning something with something (this is the burn only flammable things rule):
	if the noun is impervious, say "[The noun] cannot be burned." instead.

Check burning something with something (this is the burn only things not held rule):
	if the noun is held by the player:
		say "[one of]It occurs to you to set down [the noun] before burning, just for safety's sake. [or]Again, you decide to put down [the noun] prior to burning. [or]You try setting down [the noun] as usual. [stopping][run paragraph on]";
		silently try the player dropping the noun;
		if the player encloses the noun, stop the action.

Check burning something with something (this is the burn only tinder rule):
	if the second noun is a strikable-match:
		if the endurance of the noun > 1:
			say "The match's flame isn't strong enough to light [the noun]. You may need to put some tinder on [if the noun is part of the concert-desk][the concert-desk][otherwise][them][end if] first." instead;

The matchbox has endurance 1.

Definition: a thing is slippery:
	if it is the single-panel, decide yes;
	if it is the concert-flyer, decide yes;
	if it is the safety-manual, decide yes;
	decide no;

The can't put onto what's not a supporter rule response (A) is "[if the noun is not slippery]Putting things on [the second noun] would achieve nothing[otherwise][The noun] just slides right off. You'll have to put it on something flat[end if]."

Carry out burning something with something (this is the simplistic burning rule):
	say "You light [the noun] with [the second noun].";
	now the Fireheat of the noun is flaming.

Rule for implicitly taking the second noun while burning something with something which is not a strikable-match:

			say "flaming ";
		
Every turn when flaming-printed is true:
	now flaming-printed is false;

Understand "burn [something]" or "light [something]" as burning when the player is not in monument-region.

Instead of burning something with something when the player is in the noun:
	say "That seems dangerous given that you yourself are in [the noun]."

Instead of burning something with something when the player is on the noun:
	say "That seems dangerous given that you yourself are on [the noun]."

Report examining something flammable:
	if the noun is a strikable-match:
		say "Hm, the [printed name] appears to be [fireheat].";
	otherwise if the noun is flaming:
		say "More importantly, [the noun] [are] on fire!";

Before taking a flaming thing:
	let turns remaining be the endurance of the noun minus the burning-turns of the noun;
	if turns remaining is less than two, say "There's no portion of [the noun] sufficiently cool for you to pick up." instead.

Every turn when something is flaming:
	follow the fire rules.

The fire rules is a rulebook.

A fire rule (this is the can't hold flaming objects rule):
	repeat with item running through flaming things:
		if the item is held by the player:
			let turns remaining be the endurance of the item minus the burning-turns of the item;
			if turns remaining is less than two:
				say "[The item] becomes too hot to hold! ";
				try dropping the item;
				if the item is held by the player, say "This is certainly painful."

A fire rule (this is the flames spread rule):
	repeat with item running through flaming things:
		if the burning-turns of the item is one:
			spread the flames from the item.

A fire rule (this is the fire destroys things rule):
	now started printing is false;
	repeat with item running through flaming flammable things enclosed by the location:
		increment the burning-turns of the item;
		if the burning-turns of the item is greater than the endurance of the item, destroy the item;
	if started printing is true, say "[paragraph break]";
	now started printing is false.

Definition: a thing is vulnerable if it is flammable and it is unburnt.

[The following allows us to force fire to spread from one thing to another]
Cheatance relates a thing to a thing . The verb to cheattouch means the cheatance relation.

Reliance relates a thing (called X) to a thing (called Y) when X is part of Y or X is in Y or X is on Y or X cheattouch Y. The verb to be relying on means the reliance relation.

WeakReliance relates a thing (called X) to a thing (called Y) when X is part of Y or X is in Y or X is on Y. The verb to be weakrelying on means the weakreliance relation.

Contact relates a thing (called X) to a thing (called Y) when X is relying on Y or Y is relying on X. The verb to be joined to means the contact relation.

[Having these at our disposal makes it much tidier to write what happens next:]

To spread the flames from (item - a thing):
	now started printing is false;
	if the item is joined to a flammable unburnt thing (called the sacrifice):
		if endurance of item is 1:
			now the concert-desk is impervious;
		if the sacrifice is visible:
			now started printing is true;
			Let K be the number of flammable unburnt things which are joined to the item;
			say "[if K > 0]Flames engulf [the list of flammable unburnt things which are joined to the item][otherwise]Flames flicker from [the item][end if][if the impervious concert-desk is joined to the item]. But the fire is too small to light [the concert-desk][end if].";
		now all the flammable unburnt things joined to the item are flaming;
		now the concert-desk is flammable;

Instead of entering the concert-desk:
	say "You don't want to get splinters climbing on the desk.";

Started printing is a truth state that varies. Started printing is false.

To burn is a verb.
To destroy (item - a thing):
	let home be the holder of the item;
	if the item is part of something (called the superstructure), let home be the holder of the superstructure;
	if the item is visible:
		now started printing is true;
		say "[The item] [adapt the verb burn] away[if an undamp thing is relying on the item], leaving [the list of undamp things which are weakrelying on the item] behind[end if]. ";
		if item is the concert-roof:
			if an unburnt flammable thing is in concert-room:
				if the player is in concert-room:
					say "Flaming chunks of ceiling fall all around you, lighting [the list of flammable unburnt things in concert-room] on fire. ";
			now every unburnt flammable thing in concert-room is flaming;				
		if item is the opera-panels:
			if an unburnt flammable thing is in theater-room:
				if the player is in theater-room:
					say "Flaming chunks of ceiling fall all around you, lighting [the list of flammable unburnt things in theater-room] on fire. ";
			now every unburnt flammable thing in theater-room is flaming;				
	if something is relying on the item:
		now all the undamp things which are relying on the item are in the home;
		if a container (called currentcontainer) is relying on the item:
			now currentcontainer is open;
			now currentcontainer is unlocked;
			now currentcontainer is not openable;
			now currentcontainer is not lockable;
	now the item is nowhere;
	now the item is damp;
	now every flaming thing which is part of the item is damp.

To destroy (item - a door):
	let home be the holder of the item;
	if item is visible:
		now started printing is true;
		say "[The item] burns away[if something impervious is part of the item], leaving [the list of impervious parts of the item] behind[end if]. ";
	if home is a room, now all of the impervious parts of the item are in the home;
	now the item is damp;
	now the item is open;
	now the item is unopenable.

Before printing the name of a damp door:
	say "burnt-out frame of ".

Instead of opening or closing a damp door:
	say "[The noun] can no longer be opened or closed in any meaningful sense."

Instead of doing something other than examining or dropping to a flaming thing when the burning-turns of the noun is greater than 1:
	say "Fire has too thoroughly engulfed [the noun] for that to be a good idea."
	
Instead of going through a flaming door:
	say "That door is on fire. Running through it is a bad idea!"

Instead of taking something when the noun is in a flaming thing (called the receptacle):
	say "You don't quite dare reach into [the receptacle]."

Instead of touching something which is within a flaming thing (called the receptacle):
	say "It seems a little risky since [the receptacle] is on fire."

Instead of turning something when the noun is contained in a flaming thing (called the receptacle):
	say "It seems a little risky since [the receptacle] is on fire."

Instead of pushing or pulling something when the noun is inside a flaming thing (called the receptacle):
	say "[The receptacle] deters you."

Before burning something which is in a container when the holder of the noun contains the player:
	say "This could make things toasty for you..."

[And that completes the rules which cover burning: things can catch fire, fire will spread, and gradually consume the world in flames. All of that was general and could be used in any setting, but we now provide a small game to show it off.]

Section 4 - Matches

[The word "matches" is used by Inform to compare snippets of text (see "Reading a command" in the Activities chapter). This can sometimes cause awkwardness if we also have a kind called "match", so for the occasion we will give our matches a more specialized name, never visible to the player:]

A strikable-match is a kind of thing. The plural of strikable-match is s-matches. The description of a strikable-match is "This looks like a large but otherwise standard phosphorous match." Understand "large" or "standard" or "phosphorous" as a strikable-match.

A strikable-match has a number called duration. The duration of a strikable-match is usually 3.

Rule for printing the name of a strikable-match: say "match".
Rule for printing the plural name of a strikable-match: say "matches".

Understand "match" as a strikable-match. Understand "matches" as a strikable-match.

Before printing the name of a strikable-match while asking which do you mean:
	say "[fireheat] ".

Before printing the name of a strikable-match while taking inventory:
	say "[fireheat] ".
Before printing the plural name of a strikable-match while taking inventory:
	say "[fireheat] ".

Before printing the name of a strikable-match while clarifying the parser's choice of something:
	if not taking inventory, say "[fireheat] ".

After printing the name of a strikable-match (called special-target) while clarifying the parser's choice of something:
	if the player carries the special-target:
		say " you're carrying";
	otherwise if the special-target is in the location:
		say " on the ground";
	otherwise:
		say " [if the holder of the special-target is a container]in[otherwise]on[end if] [the holder of the special-target]".

Understand "strike [something]" as attacking.

Understand "strike [strikable-match]" as striking. Striking is an action applying to one carried thing.

Understand "burn [strikable-match]" as striking.

Does the player mean striking an unburnt strikable-match:
	it is very likely.

Does the player mean striking a burnt strikable-match:
	it is unlikely.

Check striking a strikable-match (this is the strike only new matches rule):
	if the noun is burnt, say "[The noun] has already burnt down and cannot be relit." instead;
	if the noun is flaming, say "[The noun] is already burning." instead.

Carry out striking a strikable-match (this is the standard striking rule):
	now the noun is flaming;
	now the noun is lit.

Report striking a strikable-match (this is the standard report striking rule):
	say "You light [the noun]."

Before burning something with an unburnt strikable-match (this is the prior lighting rule):
	say "(first [if the player does not carry the second noun]taking and [end if]lighting [the second noun])[command clarification break]";
	silently try striking the second noun;
	if the second noun is not flaming, stop the action.

Rule for implicitly taking a strikable-match (called target) while striking:
	try silently taking the target.

Does the player mean burning something with a flaming strikable-match:
	it is very likely.

Does the player mean burning something with an unburnt strikable-match:
	it is likely.

Does the player mean burning something with a burnt strikable-match:
	it is unlikely.

Instead of burning a burnt strikable-match with something:
	say "[The noun] is completely consumed and cannot be relit."

Section 5 - Putting the Matches Out

Every turn when there is a flaming strikable-match:
	let N be 0; [here we track how many matches are being put out during this turn, so that we don't have to mention each match individually if several go out during the same move]
	repeat with item running through flaming s-matches:
		decrement the duration of the item;
		if the duration of the item is 0:
			now the item is burnt;
			if the item is visible, increment N;
	if N is 1:
		say "[if the number of visible flaming s-matches is greater than 0]One of the matches [otherwise if the number of burnt visible s-matches is greater than 1]Your last burning match [otherwise]The match [end if]goes out and burns away.";
	otherwise if N is greater than 1:
		let enumeration be "[N in words]";
		if N is the number of visible s-matches:
			if N is two, say "Both";
			otherwise say "All [enumeration]";
		otherwise:
			say "[enumeration in title case]";
		say " matches go out and burn away[if a visible strikable-match is flaming], leaving [number of visible flaming s-matches in words] still lit[end if].";
	if the number of unburnt s-matches is 0:
		if the wooden-door is unburnt:
			say "[line break][if the number of flaming s-matches > 0]One of the flaming matches[otherwise]The flaming match[end if] [if a flaming strikable-match is held by the player]in your hand[otherwise]in the room[end if] crackles unexpectedly, bursting into greater flames than before; it must have hit a pocket of phosphorous. [if a flaming strikable-match is held by the player]You fling it away[otherwise]You kick it away[end if], and it hits the door, lighting it on fire.";
			let current be a random flaming strikable-match enclosed by the location;

			now the wooden-door is flaming;
	now every burnt strikable-match is nowhere;

If you get enough of them, you can show them to corporate or something and get credit for professional development. If you get all of them, you can process them into payment to get over the river. Although our payment processor for tokens is missing; we left it at our old location.'

He puts the token back out of sight, a little embarrassed, and says, 'Anyway, I'm going to default mode now. I'll leave you to it.'

His face alters subtly, becoming more mechanical, and assumes a greedy expression. 'Welcome, traveler. If you find any treasure, let me know; I'm quite the collector.'

'Will you give me your token if I give you treasure?' you ask.

Chapter 16 -Throne room

Understand "upward" or "upwards" as up.

Throne-room is east from ruined-courtyard. Throne-room is in castle-region. [Throne-room is south from raised-larder.] The printed name of the throne-room is "Throne Room". "This is the vast ruin of a once-glorious throne room. Pillars line the walls, some fallen and crumbling. Stairs once led [bold type]upwards[roman type], but the lower parts have collapsed, leaving a balcony and the upper part of the stairs high above you, out of your reach[if strange-veins are in throne-room]. The balcony is densely covered in strange black veins[end if].

The center of the room on the east side is a raised dais that is missing its throne. It looks like it was once flanked with rows and rows of ornate wooden poles leading down the dais to the other side, but they are all broken on the floor. To the north, under the balcony, one pair of stone supports remains[if rodheld is true], with the [iron-bar] firmly placed between them[otherwise], but the pole that once went through them is shattered[end if].

You can leave to the [boldwest][first time].

Looking around, the whole thing reminds you of something Gareth once told you. He went on for hours about how important it was for the advancement of society that monarchical rule became less and less popular over time. He always tried to work his political ideas into therapy sessions but it never really made much sense. A broken throne room would definitely be something he'd love[only]."

The throne-dais is an enterable scenery supporter in throne-room. The printed name of the throne-dais is "dais". Understand "dais" as the throne-dais. The description of the throne-dais is "This must have been beautiful, once, but all is gone, now."

Understand "strange" or "black" or "vein" or "veins" as the strange-veins. The description of the strange-veins is "Strange black veins have crawled all over the balcony above you. They seem to be coming from somewhere else in the castle."

The scenery-pillars are plural-named scenery in throne-room. The printed name of the scenery-pillars is "pillars". Understand "pillar" or "pillars" or "fallen" or "crumbling" as the scenery-pillars. The description of the scenery-pillars is "These pillars seem more decorative than functional. Those that have fallen don't seem to have weakened the surrounding structure at all."

The missing-throne is scenery in throne-room. The printed name of the missing-throne is "throne". Understand "throne" as the missing-throne.

Instead of doing something with the missing-throne:
	say "Perhaps surprisingly for a throne room, there is actually no throne here."

Instead of entering the scenery-pillars:
	say "There's just not enough handholds.";

The high-balcony is a scenery supporter in throne-room. The printed name of the high-balcony is "balcony". Understand "balcony" as the high-balcony. The description of the high-balcony is "This once must have been the landing of some stairs, but now is just a balcony, high in the air."

	if the noun is not enclosed by high-balcony:
		say "That's too far away." instead;

Understand "pair" or "pair of" or "stone" or "support" or "hole" or "holes" or "sewing" or "eyes" or "stable" or "needle" or "needles"or "supports" as the stone-pair. The description of the stone-pair is "This is a pair of stone supports, about a meter apart from each other and a few meters away from the wall. They each have a hole in them a few centimeters wide, with the holes facing each other. Overall, they look a bit like two large sewing needles stuck into the ground[if rodheld is false].

The pole they once held is long gone[otherwise].

Together, they are currently holding an iron rod[end if]."

Instead of putting something on the stone-pair:
	if rodheld is true:
		try putting the noun on the iron-bar;
	otherwise if the noun is the iron-bar:
		say "You place the iron rod through the holes in the stone supports. It fits perfectly, forming a large horizontal bar at about waist-height.";

		say "It would fit perfect between the supports, but it would need an axis of some kind to rest on.";
	otherwise:

Report someone taking iron-bar:
	now rodheld is false;

The balanced-plank2 is an enterable supporter. "The plank is here, balanced carefully."The printed name of the balanced-plank2 is "balanced plank". Understand "notched" or "plank" or "balanced" or "long" or "cupboard" as the balanced-plank2. The description of the balanced-plank2 is "This is a long plank, sturdy enough for several people to stand on. There is a notch in the center, which cuts the short way across the plank. Right now the plank is balanced."

Every turn when the player is in castle-region (this is the rod falling rule):
	if rodheld is false:

			otherwise:
				say "Your clone[setcloneact] jumps up high and then slams back down onto the plank, launching you into the air. You fly through the air and land on the balcony, right next to the stairs!";

Section 1 - Fake Arthur

fake-Arthur is a man in bio-lab. The doppelganger of arthur is fake-arthur. The printed name of fake-arthur is "Arthur". The description of fake-Arthur is "I was, and am, a healthy man: I eat mostly vegetables and whole grains; I bike; I play handball. I've managed to avoid most of the diseases that plague my fellow academics. Those who know the human body ought to be kind towards it."

Section 2 - Bio lab

The printed name of the Bio-lab is "Bio Lab". The description of the Bio-lab is "[if arthur-level is 2]Despite all of the efforts of my enemies and the administration my lab is the largest at Textor University, because I am the best. But now, because of so-called [italic type]budget cuts[roman type], much of my important equipment has been sold off.

The bureaucrats had tried to take everything from me, but still expected me to produce the ground-breaking research I've always been known for. All they had left me was the samples refrigerator, my lab table, and my microscope[otherwise]My lab is the largest at Textor University, because I've been able to secure the most funding. Last night, when all of this happened, the lab was unusually empty; the floors were going to be waxed prior to new equipment being installed. 

However, I was still able to conduct my most recent research. All I needed was the samples refrigerator, my lab table, and my microscope, none of which had been moved[end if].

The protocol poster I had established for the students hung prominently on the wall.

I could go [boldeast] to the Data Lab or [boldsouth] to the department hallway."

The protocol-poster is scenery in bio-lab. The printed name of the protocol-poster is "protocol poster". Understand "protocol" or "poster" as the protocol-poster. The description of the protocol-poster is "My poster was written in simple language, to help my rather incompetent assistants.

[italic type]1. Retrieve unmarked samples from the refrigerator.[line break]2. Put unmarked samples into the microscope.[line break]3. Look in the microscope to examine the slide, and look for distinguishing features.[line break]4. Mark any samples that have line-shaped nano devices with the red marker. Mark samples that are roughly circular with the blue marker.[line break]5. Replace the samples in the fridge, and enter the data in the Data Lab[roman type][if arthur-level is 2]

And I did follow the protocol, in the beginning. I want you to know that[end if]."

Instead of taking the protocol-poster:
	say "I spent quite a bit on this poster; I didn't want to destroy it."

The unwaxed-floors are scenery floor in the bio-lab. The printed name of the unwaxed-floors is "floors". Understand "floor" or "floors" as the unwaxed-floors. The description of the unwaxed-floors is "The floors had not yet been waxed, and were in poor repair. For all the funding I provide the university, one would think that they would have better maintenance protocols."

Instead of putting something on the unwaxed-floors:
	try dropping the noun;

The lab-table is a scenery supporter in bio-lab. The printed name of the lab-table is "lab table". Understand "lab" or "wood" or "plastic"or "top" or "tops" or "table" as the lab-table. The description of the lab-table is "Due to several recent accidents from clumsy assistants, our tables are simple wood with plastic tops, cheap and easy to replace."

The Samples-fridge is a closed openable scenery container in bio-lab. The printed name of samples-fridge is "samples refrigerator". Understand "sample" or "samples" or "fridge" or "refrigerator" as the samples-fridge. The description of samples-fridge is "This refrigerator, the only one currently in the lab, held the results of my most recent experiment, a groundbreaking accomplishment that would assure government funding for a decade[if arthur-level is 2]. 

At least, that's what I had been telling the higher ups. I hadn't actually needed the fridge for weeks[end if]."

A sample-slide is a kind of thing. Understand "slide" or "slides" or "sample" or "nano" or "device" or "devices" as a sample-slide.

Instead of taking the other-slides:
	say "I had already marked those slides, so there was no need to interact with them further."

Dishesslopped is a truth state that varies. Dishesslopped is false.

The false-slides are plural-named things. "[if arthur-level is 2]The slides, the results of my failed experiments, lay together on the table, a symbol of the sacrifices I had had to make in the name of science.[otherwise if dataread is true]All of the slides...my experiment was ruined![otherwise if dishesslopped is true]I couldn't believe one of my researchers ruined the slides...I had to check the data.[otherwise]The samples...why were the samples out of the fridge?[end if]"

Does the player mean examining the samples-fridge:
	it is unlikely;

 The printed name of the false-slides is "sample slides". Understand "sample" or "samples" or "slide" or "slides" as the false-slides. The description of the false-slides is "[if arthur-level is 2]The slides didn't matter, not now. They were for show, something to parade for visitors. I had made a great deal before about marking them and studying them in front of my students. Most of them never knew the difference. How could they[otherwise]The samples had been left out of the fridge. And all of them were marked red, despite some clearly belonging to the blue category...Who did this[dishesslopped][end if]?"

Instead of inserting the false-slides into the lab-micro:
	say "There was no point in further contaminating this research.";

Instead of taking the false-slides:
	say "There was no point in further contaminating this research."

After opening the samples-fridge when arthur-level is 0:
	say "I opened the refrigerator[one of], revealing the last two samples to be marked, sample 4B and sample 5C. The other samples I had previously marked were also in the refrigerator[or], revealing [the list of things in samples-fridge][stopping]."

Sample-4B is a sample-slide in the samples-fridge. Sample-5C is a sample-slide in the samples-fridge. The printed name of Sample-4B is "sample 4B". Understand "4b" or "rb" as sample-4b. Understand "5c" or "tc" as sample-5c. The printed name of sample-5c is "sample 5C". The description of sample-4B is "This was one of the more confusing samples of the experiment, and had been left for last, along with sample 5C. I couldn't see any pertinent details without the use of the microscope."

The description of sample-5C is "This was one of the more confusing samples of the experiment, and had been left for last, along with sample 4B. I couldn't see any pertinent details without the use of the microscope."

Report examining a marked sample-slide:
	say "This sample had already been marked."

The other-slides are plural-named things in samples-fridge. The printed name of the other-slides is "other samples". Understand "slides" or "samples" or "previously" or "Marked" or "other" as the other-slides. The description of the other-slides is "The slides I had previously painstakingly marked were in the fridge already, where I had carefully placed them after analyzing them."

The lab-micro is a scenery thing in bio-lab. The printed name of the lab-micro is "microscope". Understand "microscope" or "micro" or "scope" as the lab-micro.

The description of the lab-micro is "[if arthur-level is 2]The microscope was also here for show, although I did use it from time to time when the dean visited[otherwise]While far from our most powerful microscope, this one served well enough for the experiment in question. It was easy to PUT slides INTO the microscope and to LOOK IN the microscope[end if]."

The lab-micro is an open unopenable container. The lab-micro can be switched on or switched off. The lab-micro is switched on.

Instead of examining a sample-slide when the noun is in the lab-micro:
	try searching the lab-micro;

Understand "put [something] under [the lab-micro]" as inserting it into.

Before inserting something into the lab-micro:
	if the noun is not a sample-slide:
		say "Only slides could fit in the microscope, of course." instead;
	otherwise if the number of sample-slides in lab-micro > 0:
		say "Only one slide could fit in the microscope at once." instead;

Instead of searching the lab-micro:
	if the lab-micro is switched off:
		say "I couldn't see anything, as the microscope was turned off.";
	otherwise if sample-4b is in the lab-micro:
		say "Looking through the microscope, the nano devices on sample 4B were forming heavily diversified and sharply linear striations that exhibited both annealing and vector-like properties.";
		now sample-4b is microed;
	otherwise if sample-5c is in the lab-micro:
		say "Looking through the microscope, the nano devices on sample 5C had formed an conglomerated ovoid sediment exhibiting weak tension and a spherical nature.";
		now sample-5c is microed;
	otherwise:
		say "There was no slide in the microscope to look at."

A sample-slide can be microed or not microed. A sample-slide is usually not microed.

A marker is a kind of thing. A marker has some text called the markercolor. Understand "marker" or "pen" as a marker. Understand the markercolor property as describing a marker.

The red-marker is a marker on lab-table. The printed name of the red-marker is "red marker". The markercolor of red-marker is "red".

The description of the red-marker is "Red, a color suited for strength and masculinity, was, in deference to society, used to mark failed samples in this experiment. 

I had marked with red all samples that were shaped like lines, to put things in layman's terms."

The blue-marker is a marker on lab-table. The printed name of the blue-marker is "blue marker". The markercolor of blue-marker is "blue". The description of the blue-marker is "Blue is soothing, and I used it to symbolize to the rather simple-minded students in my lab that a sample was suited for our experiment. 

I mainly used it for marking samples that were roughly circle-shaped, to put things in layman's terms."

Marking it with is an action applying to two things. Understand "mark [something] with [something]" as marking it with.

Does the player mean marking something with a marker:
	it is very likely;

[make sure you can only mark important things]

A sample-slide can be marked or unmarked. A sample-slide is usually unmarked.
Sloppynoticed is a truth state that varies. Sloppynoticed is false.

To mark is a verb.

Understand "mark" as sample-4b when sample-4b is marked.
Understand "mark" as sample-5c when sample-5c is marked.

Understand "remove [a sample-slide]" as rubbing.

Instead of rubbing a marked sample-slide:
	say "You rub the mark off of [the noun].";
	now the noun is not marked;

Carry out marking it with:
	if the second noun is a marker:
		if the second noun is not held:

			silently try taking the second noun;
		if the noun is a sample-slide:
			if the noun is not microed:
				say "I hadn't examined the slide yet. As a responsible researcher, I couldn't mark the slide without using the microscope first to identify the correct type of nano device I was seeing.";
			otherwise if the noun is unmarked:
				say "[We] [adapt the verb mark] [the noun] with [the second noun].";
				now the noun is marked;
			otherwise:
				say "[We] already [adapt the verb mark] [the noun].";
		otherwise if the noun is the false-slides:

		otherwise:
			say "I'm not in the habit of drawing with markers like a child, Detective. I only used them to mark my sample slides.";
	otherwise:

Dataentered is a truth state that varies. Dataentered is false.
Dataread is a truth state that varies. Dataread is false.

That means you think I'll actually become a professor like you! That's the first time you've said anything like that. I just wanted to say thank you for the motivation.'

I smiled, despite the pain in my face. 'Don't let it go to your head, Dafydd. But yes, I think you might be able to find a position, most likely at a second-tier institution. In any case, it is time for me to leave. Good day, Dafydd.'

 I could use my parkour talents to get [bold type]up[roman type] the walls!

I also could have gone back. The wildly dangerous intersection was to the [boldnorth][otherwise if mari-level is 1]The alleyway was a great place to hide from the bikers.

I could also return to the intersection back to the [boldnorth][otherwise]Okay, so this was less of an alleyway and more of a path leading to a park.

It's at least two hours of work for me! So because you cost me two hours of work, you're going to pay me two hours of work.'

By then the car had stopped, and Dad opened the door. There in front of us was a UCD Courier office.

'Dad, no!' I cried.

'Dad, yes!' he said. 'Here's your uniform. Go change.'

I grabbed the uniform and changed in the limo changing room, with Dad banging on the door after two minutes to say I was taking too long. Finally, I got out. He gave me a brief rundown on what couriers do (and obviously I already knew that?) and pushed me out onto the curb.

The printed name of train-locker is "Locker Room". The description of train-locker is "This morning I was in the locker room.

I was upset because some fool had totalled my car the night before. Of course I was able to take a train to work; I have a discount. But it was going to cost me quite a bit of money. That lay heavily on my mind while I was getting ready[otherwise if elen-level is 2].

This one had a silver cross, so it was a silver dagger[delivercroes]."

They're designed to last a long time, so they prepared for the patina,' she says[otherwise if currenttarget is maeve]'Wait, really?' says Maeve. 'So that kind of box is for a letter opener?'

She looks genuinely relieved[otherwise if currenttarget is mari]'I don't know why you guys are talking about Croes brand,' says Mari. 'That stuff's pretty cheap.'

You may need to connect this idea even further to get more out of him[otherwise if currenttarget is maeve]'Oh my goodness,' she says. 'That's what was in the box. He has a deadly weapon,' she says. She looks nervously over at Arthur[otherwise if currenttarget is elen]'Really?' she says, her interest piqued. 'He has good taste. I'll have to talk to him once all of this is over. Although I hope you realize how bad it looks for him to own such a weapon,' she adds[otherwise]Mari snorts. 'He would have poor taste like that,' she says[end if].".

Gwen is a woman in train-locker. "Gwen, another veteran of the railroad, was finishing up as well." The description of Gwen is "Gwen was a few years older than me, a frivolous woman given to excess in imagination."

			say "'What is it, Gwen? You seem excited by something,' I said rather sternly.

	'Oh, not excited at all, Elen,' she said in a high-pitched, lisping kind of voice that has always reminded me of that of a baby. It was mildly infuriating.

	'What, then?' I intoned.

	'Haven't you heard about all the thefts recently? Someone's been stealing from passengers on the train. It's an epidemic!' she said.

	'Not just passengers,' I added. 'Someone's been taking things from our lockers as well. Just today I happened to find my water bottle missing. It's the younger generation, you know. No discipline.'

	Gwen tutted and shook her head. 'Dreadful, that,' she said.

	'While I've enjoyed our little discussion, I'm afraid I must be off,' I told her, and she pouted but accepted it with a wave goodbye.";
		otherwise if elen-level is 1 :
			say "'Gee, Elen, you seem upset,' said Gwen in her voice, a little-kid voice which was grating coming from a grown woman.

	'Some jerk hit my car last night on the way home from work. I had to take the train this morning, Second Class,' I said, bitterly.

	Gwen tutted and said, 'Poor Elen. I'm sorry to hear that. People just have no decency any more. Just like all the thefts going on. They say even some attendants are losing their things.'

	'A damaged car is a much bigger problem than some missing earrings,' I said curtly. Gwen looked hurt by my tone, so I softened it and said, 'But I know what you mean. No moral character these days. In any case, I must be off.' 

	Gwen waved goodbye politely.";
		otherwise if elen-level is 2:
			say "'What was that you were looking at?' asked Gwen, her brows furrowed.

'A gift from a friend,' I said quietly.

'Oooh, a lover,' she said. Gwen often used such silly language, most likely from her books she was always reading. 'Is it roses?' she asked.

'No,' I said. 'Just chocolates.'

'Lucky!' said Gwen. 'Make sure you hide them good; the locker thief has been especially bad this week.'

'I'll keep an eye out, Gwen,' I said. 'Thanks for the reminder.'

This woman could be deeply annoying, but at least she was easily misled. It was time to make my exit, though.";

Typical that I was the one being given additional responsibilities, a 'reward' for being a good worker. 'Of course, sir,' I answered politely, hiding my anger. 'Right away[otherwise if elen-level is 1]You're late.' It was an accusation.

I bristled, but kept my cool. Anger would only end up with me losing my job.

'My car was in an accident yesterday,' I said. 'Some young hooligan ran into it when it was parked. I had to take an early train.'

'Is that so?' he said, seeming unimpressed. 'Well, we just had to send off the B-Line train without you. Now we're short on the A-Line. Why don't you get in there, and do your job,' he said, pointing at the train.

'Of course sir,' I said. 'Right away[otherwise]We're missing crew today because of that undercooked sausage at the pizza party last night. I know you were scheduled for the B-Line today, but we need you on the A-Line. Can you do that?'

I was annoyed, because the B-line was usually much more profitable. I couldn't tell him that, though. 'Of course, sir,' I answered politely, hiding my anger. 'Right away[end if].'

'Good,' he said, not even caring how I responded or felt. 'We have a light load, since we're sending this over early for the holiday rush later today. There's a police officer in the lavatory I already ticketed in First Class, but make sure to grab the tickets of anyone else aboard.'

'Of course,' I said dryly. As if I needed an explanation of how to do my job.

I took the watch he held out and looked it over. I have some experience with high-end luxury goods, and I could tell at once this would cover my car. Twice, in fact, but I didn't tell him that.

'That's fine,' I said, and put it on[deliverpresent].

The train began to thrum, and the doors started to close. Just then, a courier burst in, breathing heavily. Her eyes locked with Dafydd. 'What are you doing here?' he said, seeming deeply confused.

[only]You are on the rim of a vast chamber that stretches off beyond the range of your vision. You have to lean against the wall to keep your balance; there's not enough room on the ledge for you to stand straight. The rocks below you form a cliff that goes down at least a hundred meters, maybe more. At the bottom lies an underground lake of pure blackness which laps gently up and down[if beastgone is true].

The room smells awful now, and the water bubbles from time to time[end if][if the distant-gleam is in vast-room].

Far to the north, there is a distant gleam of gold[end if].

The crevice is [boldsouthwest] from here. You can inch your way around to the [boldwest] and [boldsoutheast].

There is also a rickety ladder leading [bolddown], but it looks very unsafe[if the slaughter-stains are in vast-room]. Stains and scratches mark the edge now[end if]."

There's nothing to hold on to, and just looking down makes you dizzy.

The cliff plummets straight down for at least a few dozen meters, maybe more, maybe many, many more. It's so hard to tell from way up here."

The vast-wall is scenery in vast-room. The printed name of the vast-wall is "wall". UNderstand "wall" as the vast-wall.

Understand "darkness" or "pure" or "water" or "bubble" or "bubbles" or "lake" as the underground-lake. The description of the underground-lake is "This lake is unfathomable in a literal sense.

[one of]No, not a maelstrom. A [or]It is the [stopping]mouth, a hideous mouth for some being that is wide as the horizon itself. After what feels like minutes, you pass into the ring, and are engulfed. ";
			if rotting-player is true:

As you lose consciousness, you can feel your skin bursting and the infection inside of you leaking in every direction. The beast around you trembles and it is like the earth itself being rent in twain. The water bubbles around you as the infection spreads.

Section 3 - The ladder

Before going down from vast-room:

The vast-ladder is a room in spell-region. The printed name of the vast-ladder is "Rickety Ladder".

You immediately feel a tension between you and the door. An irresistible force builds, but something seems to be holding you in place.

It almost feels like your bones are going to shatter when, instead, the portcullis explodes into hundreds of metal shards, which hurl at you like bullets.

The spell cuts out right before they hit you, the tug vanishing. You dive to the ground, and the shards pass over your head and out into the passageway behind you.

The portcullis is now open.";

We are in the bowels of the ship, the long-term stores of materials. The pack beasts of the great city in the stars.

Computer commands, seen as spells! Robots seen as monstrous beasts! 

'I myself am a simple AI, transmitting through grounded temporary wires spread by helpful bots, but you see me as a horrible spider, don't you?'

And I knew that you would ask that question just now.'

'And just who is this person?' you ask.

'Emrys Tisserand,' he answers. 

'But I'm--' you start before he cuts you off.

'Could I do this to Emrys Tisserand?' he asks, before speaking a word in a language at once familiar and foreign. Your right arm dissolves into a hundred shifting particles of dust before reforming.

'You are a robot. When Emrys Tisserand touched that gem, you activated in our little graveyard. Your mind was filled with a digital copy of Emrys['] mind, and a duplicate recorder was created and given to you. She is controlling you right now, although she doesn't know it. And you're transmitting all of this to her,' he says. 'At some point, she will disconnect from you, and you will die, because you aren't even sentient. You're simply a hollow vessel.'

He goes on: 'But enough of questions. I will not allow you to ask any more, except for the one you came here for.'"

'Why? Why hide all of this? Why hide the bear from me? Why make me suffer? What is the time that will come?' you demand.

'Because it was fated. This is the string of fate. To step off the path is to risk non-existence. Perhaps I enjoyed torturing you; perhaps I hated it, feared it, but was forced to by fate. You will never know.

'You must find Emrys Tisserand. You must give her the bear. You'll need this,' he says, and lobs a webbed scroll at you.

'Goodbye, little one,' he says. 'And don't worry, you already know where Emrys is. The feedback from your connection gets overwhelming when you are near her, distorting your reality. The scroll will help.'

You hold the scroll tight and nod in understanding."

There is a scream, and the darkness in this room physically retracts, peeling off the walls like paint. As it moves, more and more light can be seen in the room, and you can see that the darkness was actually some kind of thick, viscous substance. It tugs itself out from under you, and you step back onto plain rock.

In front of you is a thick globule of the stuff hanging from the ceiling; at your feet is a pile of dead creatures emitting a disgusting odor, and nearby is a pool of some clear liquid that has chunks of bone floating in it.

Chapter 18 - The black dome and finale

[we defined the black dome earlier]

Section 1 - The black dome itself

The description of black-dome is "You are in a perfectly hemispherical room. The floor is some kind of flat concrete or dull rock, while the dome that bounds the room is dark, opaque glass. There is a loud hum all around you, and you get the impression of being far underground.

In the center of the room is a pedestal that nestles a single, gray gem that emits a sickly gray light.

The light makes it hard to see anything beyond the glass."

Understand "woman" or "emrys" or "tisserand" or "real" or "older" or "eyes" or "eye" or "dark" or "square" or "jaw" as fake-emrys.

Understand "emrys" or "tisserand" or "storyweaver" or "lieutenant" as fake-emrys.

Instead of doing anything except giving the teddy-bear to fake-emrys when the player is in black-dome:
	if the current action is examining or looking or taking inventory:
		continue the action;
	otherwise:
		say "[one of]Your usefulness has come to an end. There's nothing left for you but to give the bear to Emrys.[or]That's enough. Give the bear to Emrys.[or]Fine. I'll do it myself.[giveaction][line break][stopping]"

Instead of examining the player when the player is in black-dome:

In front of you is a rough-shaped humanoid made of what looks like gritty sand, holding a teddy bear.

It--She?--looks at herself in surprise. 'I didn't think there'd be any of me left,' she says. Her voice is just like yours. 

Her leg starts to dissolve, and she sags to one side. 'Oh dear,' she says, looking at her leg, then at the bear. 'I think this is yours,' she says, handing you the toy.

'I guess the spider lied,' she says, as her entire lower half crumbles into pieces, her torso sinking down. 'I didn't expect to still be here.'

'It's okay,' you say. You realize that you don't even know her name, or if something like her even has a name.

'Yeah, it'll all be okay. It was nice, being you,' she says, looking at her hand, which dissolves completely. 'Real nice.'

There is a sound of rushing sand, and then she is gone. Nothing remains but a pile of black nanobots, fine as sand.

The gray gem goes dark.";
	now the gray-gem is inactive;
	now the dead-nanobots is in gem-room;
	
Every turn when teddy-bear is held by the player and the player is in ship-region:

Companion-quip is a quip. The printed name of companion-quip is "Companion". Understand "companion" as companion-quip. The target of companion-quip is little-girl. The preview of Companion-quip is "I have your bear!"

The targetresponse of companion-quip is "'Prove it!' says the little girl. 'I think you're tricking me.' Her voice is obstinate. 'Show me my bear!'"

The dead-nanobots is scenery. The printed name of the dead-nanobots is "pile of dead nanobots". Understand "pile" or "Of dead" or "pile of" or "nanobot" or "black" or "sand" or "nanobots" as the dead-nanobots.

Instead of giving the teddy-bear to the little-girl:
	say "'Teddy!' she says. 

'I'll hold him right here. It looks safe for you if you crawl carefully. Do you think you can do that?' you say gently.

'Yeah, I'll try,' says the girl. She inches her way across the floor and under the rubble.

When she gets out, she grabs her bear, and says, 'Thank you!'

'Do you know where your parents are?' you ask. 

'They always told me our evac center was Floor 7,' she says. 

'Do you know how to get there?' you ask. Your feel confident that this girl will be safe on her own, now.

'Yeah, that's where my school is,' she answers. 'Can I go there?'

'Run on,' you say, patting her on the back. She takes off down the hallway.

The rift behind you turns from dark red to green.

The targetresponse of rescued-quip is "'Really?' says Sergeant Olgin, her face lightening. 'That's a relief. We could use some good news. Thanks, Emrys. Where is she now?'

'I let her run up to Floor 7 on her own,' you answer.

Sergeant Olgin splutters a bit. 'Emrys! She's a child! Let me check...' She turns and speaks silently for a second, her hand on her earpiece, before turning back. 'Yeah, she made it safe. You scared me there!'"

Part 9 - Combat dimension

Chapter 1 - Brig

[moved]


Chapter 2 - Preliminaries and Max and Dan

The combat-region is a region. 

Instead of going nowhere when the player is in combat-region:
	if the noun is down:
		say "There aren't any visible trapdoors or holes in the floor.";
	otherwise if the noun is up:
		say "Looks like there's just roof up there, and no way to reach it.";
	otherwise:
		say "You don't see any exit that way; you can only go [exit list] from here."

The combat-roof is a distant backdrop in combat-region. Understand "roof" or "ceiling" as the combat-roof. The printed name of the combat-roof is "ceiling". The description of the combat-roof is "The ceiling is inconspicuous, designed to blend in with the rest of the room. It's also very high and out of your reach."

The combat-floor is a backdrop in combat-region. Understand "floor" as the combat-floor. The printed name of the combat-floor is "floor". The description of the combat-floor is "The floor looks completely solid." 

The combat-walls are a plural-named backdrop in combat-region. Understand "wall" or "walls" as the combat-walls. The printed name of the combat-walls is "walls". The description of the combat-walls is "The walls blend in with the rest of the room." 

Instead of putting something on the combat-floor:
	try dropping the noun;

Section 1 - Max and Dan basics

A robot is a kind of man. Understand "robot" or "droid" as a robot.

A memory-slot is a kind of thing. 

Combat-kitchen is a room. The Glassed-kitchen is a closed unopenable transparent container in combat-kitchen. Max is a robot in glassed-kitchen. Dan is a robot. The description of Max is "Max is a boxy, armored robot with crimson and navy markings spelling MAX on his chest. He wears a stoic expression that seems to be built into his face.

You can see three memory slots on Max, labelled [the list of memory-slots incorporated by Max], of which [currentslot of Max] is activated[deliverslots][if something is carried by max].

Max is holding [a list of things carried by Max][end if].

He is currently [if max is enclosed by combat-kitchen]helping you out with cooking[otherwise unless a replayful scene is happening]not in a situation where replay of commands is allowed[otherwise if max-blaster is not held by max]capable of replaying any recorded actions[otherwise if max is deactivated]out of the fight[otherwise]still able to fight[end if]." The description of Dan is "Dan is a tall, lithe robot with the word DAN painted in black on his silver body.

You can see three memory slots on Dan, labelled [the list of memory-slots incorporated by Dan], of which [currentslot of Dan] is activated[deliverslots][if something is carried by dan].

Dan is holding [a list of things carried by dan][end if].

He is currently [unless a replayful scene is happening]not in a situation where replay of commands is allowed[otherwise if dan-blaster is not held by dan]capable of replaying any recorded actions[otherwise if dan is deactivated]out of the fight[otherwise]still able to fight[end if].".

To say deliverslots:
	deliver slots-quip
	
Slots-quip is a quip. The printed name of Slots-quip is "Transcribing". Understand "transcribing" as slots-quip. The preview of slots-quip is "How do your memory slots work?"

The target of slots-quip is Max.

The targetresponse of slots-quip is "[if the player is in combat-kitchen]'Ask me about that later,' says Max. 'Those recording slots are too complex for me to describe in this tutorial area. If you figure them out, you can use them, but otherwise, I vote that we wait.'[otherwise]Max assumes a rigid posture, and says in a slightly different voice:

[italic type]Welcome to Memory Slots Help! Memory slots can be used to help your robot achieve their full potential!

Each robot has 3 memory slots. While these memory slots have default names, you can rename them at any time, such as RENAME SLOT X CHARLIE. Then its name will be Slot Charlie!

Each memory slot can record up to five actions. First, tell your robot: MAX, RECORD.

Then, give it the five commands you want it to repeat, such as: MAX, WAIT.

Once all five commands are full, you can tell the robot to replay them with MAX, REPLAY. Replaying can be started at any time but will only take effect in special situations. You will be alerted when replaying can take effect.

To switch between slots at any time, just ACTIVATE SLOT Y, or whichever slot you are interested in.[roman type]

Then Max falls silent.[end if]"

Every turn when a robot (called currentrobot) forsakes slots-quip:
	if currentrobot is in the location:
		now currentrobot does not forsake slots-quip;

Understand "boxy" or "armor" or "armored" or "crimson" or "navy" or "markings" or "marking" or "chest" or "lugubrious" or "expression" or "face" as max.

Understand "tall" or "lithe" or "paint" or "black" or "silver" or "body" as Dan.

[Max is kind of gloomy but mischievous]

[Dan is warmhearted and dumb]

Definition: a robot is nonrecording if it is not recording.

Unsuccessful attempt by nonrecording Max doing something:

[The block giving rule is not listed in the check giving it to rules when the second noun is a robot. The block showing rule is not listed in the check showing it to rules when the second noun is a robot. ]

The block showing rule does nothing when the person asked is a robot.

Instead of asking a robot for something: try asking the noun to try giving the second noun to the player.

After a robot (called currentbot) taking inventory:
	say "[The actor] looks through his possessions. 'I'm carrying [a list of things carried by the actor].'"

Carry out a robot (called Currentbot) showing something to someone:
	if the second noun is the player:
		say "[The Currentbot] shows you [the noun]. [run paragraph on]";
		try examining the noun;
	otherwise:

Section 3 - Recording

Understand "memory" or "slot" as a memory-slot. 
Slot-A is a memory-slot. Slot-B is a memory-slot. Slot-C is a memory-slot. Slot-A, Slot-B, and Slot-C are part of Dan. 

Definition: a memory-slot is a dan-slot if it is part of Dan.

Slot-X is a memory-slot. Slot-Y is a memory-slot. Slot-Z is a memory-slot. Slot-X, Slot-Y, and Slot-Z are part of Max. 

The nickname of slot-a is "A". The nickname of slot-b is "B". The nickname of slot-c is "C".
The nickname of slot-x is "X". The nickname of slot-Y is "Y". The nickname of slot-z is "Z".

Definition: a memory-slot is a max-slot if it is part of Max.

A memory-slot has a list of actions called command-list. 

A robot has a list of actions called memory-list.

A robot can be recording, playing back, or neutral. A robot is usually neutral.

A robot has a memory-slot called currentslot. Currentslot of dan is slot-a. Currentslot of Max is slot-x.

The description of a memory-slot is usually "[The printed name] is a memory slot embedded within [the holder of item described]. It is currently displaying the following information:

'This slot is [if item described is not currentslot of the holder of the noun]not [end if]currently activated. 

'This slot contains [the number of entries in command-list of the noun] recorded action[if the number of entries in command-list of the noun > 1]s[end if] out of 5 possible.

'This slot can be renamed by the command [']rename [the item described] [italic type]your new name[roman type]['].'"

Naming it with is an action applying to one thing and one topic. Understand "rename [something] [text]" as naming it with when the player is in combat-region. Check naming it with: say "Naming only applies to memory slots." 

A memory-slot has some text called the nickname. 

The printed name of a memory-slot is usually "Slot [the nickname]".

Understand the nickname property as describing a memory-slot.

Instead of naming a memory-slot (called tempslot) with something: 
	let N be "[the topic understood]"; 
	replace the text "'" in N with ""; 
	now the nickname of tempslot is "[N]"; 
	say "The memory-slot is now known as [nickname of tempslot].";
	now the printed name of tempslot is "Slot [the nickname of tempslot]";

Slotactivating is an action applying to one thing. Understand "activate [something]" as slotactivating when a robot is enclosed by the location.

Slotactivating is freeacting.

Instead of asking someone to try slotactivating something:
	if the noun is not part of the person asked:
		say "[The person asked] says, 'That slot doesn't belong to me!'";
		try nothingaction;
	otherwise:
		try slotactivating the noun;

Check slotactivating:
	if the noun is not a memory-slot:
		say "You can only activate memory slots." instead;
	otherwise:
		repeat with current running through robots enclosed by the location:
			if the noun is currentslot of current:
				say "That slot is already activated!" instead;

Carry out slotactivating:
	if the actor is a robot:
		now the actor is neutral;
	if the noun is a dan-slot:
		now the currentslot of dan is the noun;
	otherwise if the noun is a max-slot:
		now the currentslot of max is the noun;

Report slotactivating:
	say "'[The noun] is now activated,' says [if the noun is a dan-slot]Dan[otherwise]Max[end if]."

transcribing is an action applying to nothing. Understand "record" as transcribing. 

Carry out an actor transcribing:
	if the actor is the player:

	otherwise if the actor is clone-you:
		say "'Recording is your job,'[setcloneact] says your clone.";
	otherwise if the actor is a robot:
		if the number of entries in command-list of currentslot of the actor > 4:
			say "'That slot is full. Would you like to write over the old recording?' asks [the actor].

Yes/no?>";

			now the actor is recording;

Finishing is an action applying to nothing. Understand "finish" as finishing when a robot is enclosed by the location. Finishing is freeacting.

Lastasked is a person that varies.

Before asking someone to try doing something:
	now lastasked is the person asked;

Carry out an actor finishing:
	if the actor is the player:
		if a recording robot is in the location:
			try lastasked finishing;
		otherwise:
			say "There are no recording robots to issue that command to.";
	otherwise if the actor is not recording:
		say "'I can only use the FINISH command when I'm recording[if the actor is Dan], boss[end if]!' says [the actor].";

		truncate command-list of currentslot of the actor to 5 entries;
		say "'The remaining commands in this slot have been filled with WAIT[if briefflag is false].

'[otherwise]. [end if]Recording of [currentslot of the actor] is now full. Recording off[if briefflag is false],' says [the actor]. 'You can now ask me to REPLAY or activate another slot.'[otherwise]. [end if]";
		now the actor is neutral;


Nothingaction is an action applying to nothing. [This is only for tricking the game into thinking an action was successful when redirecting it via before clauses, thus avoiding our unsuccessful attempt clauses.]

Carry out nothingaction:
	do nothing;

When a replayful scene begins:
	repeat with current running through robots:
		now memory-list of current is {};
		add command-list of currentslot of current to memory-list of current;

	if botlist is not empty:
		if combat-blue is not in the location: 
			say "'Replay deactivated,' say[if the number of entries in botlist < 2]s[otherwise] both[end if] [botlist]."

Briefflag is a truth state that varies. Briefflag is false.

Every turn when briefflag is true:
	now briefflag is false;

Before a recording robot (called currentbot) doing anything (this is the robot recording rule):
	if the current action is currentbot transcribing:
		say "'Not recorded; due to recursion, recording is not an allowable command to record,' says [the actor].";
		try nothingaction instead;
	otherwise if the current action is currentbot replaying:
		say "'Recording is still proceeding,' says [the currentbot]. 'Would you like to stop recording early, fill the remaining commands with WAIT, and start replaying?'

Yes/no?>";
		if the player consents:
			now briefflag is true;
			try currentbot finishing;
		otherwise:
			say "'Replay cancelled. Recording still in progress,' says [the currentbot] instead.";
			try nothingaction;
	otherwise if the current action is currentbot finishing:
		do nothing;
	otherwise if the number of entries in command-list of currentslot of currentbot < 4:

The robot recording rule is listed first in the before rulebook.

Before asking a robot (called currentbot) to try doing something:
	if currentbot is playing back:
		say "'New command detected. Playing back turned off,' says [the currentbot].";
		now currentbot is neutral;

replaying is an action applying to nothing. Understand "replay" as replaying. 

Does the player mean an actor playing a memory-slot:
	if the noun is currentslot of the actor:
		it is likely;

Carry out a robot trying playing something:
	try the actor replaying;
		
Carry out an actor replaying:
	if the actor is the player:
		say "That's not something you are capable of.";
	otherwise if the actor is clone-you:
		say "'I don't think I can do that,' [setcloneact]says your clone.";

			otherwise:
				if the actor is Max:
					say "[if briefflag is false]'Very well. [end if]I'll start replaying the next time we enter an active situation,' says Max[if the player is in combat-kitchen]. 'Like a fight or something. But nothing like that will happen in the kitchen, so I guess you'll have to wait.' He shrugs[end if].";
				otherwise:

	otherwise:
		say "[The actor] [are] confused.";

A scene can be replayful or not replayful. A scene is usually not replayful.
	
Every turn when a robot is playing back (this is the robot fighting rule):

'Why, of course not,' answers the man. 'It's destiny at fault my dear, not me. But that brings me to my own problem. I would like to be substantially better off than I am now. And you may not know it, love, but you are quite a subject of interest among my clientele.'

'That seems highly implausible,' you say frostily. 

'Well, be it as it may, I will tell you what I will do. You are free to use my facility to your utmost desire. However, I will retain control over all footage and recordings of today's events, and have full distribution rights, including use in advertising for Adventureland,' he rattles off quickly.

'And if I refuse?' you ask.

'That's the thing, Emrys,' he says, flashing a brilliant smile at you. 'It's destiny. I already know you're going to go in. In any case, I've fulfilled my legal obligation, and I must inform you that from this point on, everything you say and do may be used in glorious, fun, and exciting advertisements for Adventureland.

Assembly-scene ends beautifully when every unimportante robot-piece is part of robot-torso.

When assembly-scene ends beautifully:
	say "As the last piece falls into place, a loud bell rings.

There is a bright flash and a sound like thunder. The conveyor belt stops, and the robot on the belt stands up.

An assembly-button is a kind of thing. Understand "button" or "buttons" as an assembly-button.

An assembly-button has a robot-piece called the button-piece. 

Buttonquest is a number that varies. Buttonquest is 0.

Every turn when buttonquest is not 0:
	now buttonquest is 0;

After printing the name of an assembly-button while asking which do you mean:
	increment buttonquest;
	
After asking which do you mean when buttonquest > 3:
	say "[one of][line break]'Why are there so many buttons?' you say to Max, complaining.

'Eh, we had to come up with some kind of activity that uses all 5 commands in my memory slot,' he says. 'It was either this or the cha-cha, and I'm no dancer.'[or][no line break][stopping]"

To try is a verb.

Instead of an actor taking an assembly-button:
	say "[The actor] [adapt the verb try] to take [the noun], but it is adhered to the console."

Before listing nondescript items when the player is in assembly-line: 
	say "You can see numerous buttons corresponding to different body parts here on the console, as well as a big white button labelled START."; 
	repeat with current running through assembly-buttons: 
		now current is not marked for listing; 

Maxarrival is a scene. Maxarrival begins when the player is in assembly-line and max is in assembly-line.

When maxarrival begins:
	say "He waves and says, 'Behold, the Laboratory of Cooperation! In this room, we must truly become a team, because our task is gravely important: to create life! By which I mean, we're going to assemble another robot to help us. That'll mean more guns, later.'

He points to the memory slots on his body, and says, 'With these memory slots I can RECORD and REPLAY exactly five commands in a loop. When you hit the white button, we'll have five minutes to assemble a robot together. For more details, take a look at my slots or check the poster on the wall!'";

The button-console is scenery in assembly-line. Understand "console" as the button-console. The printed name of the button-console is "console". The description of the button-console is "This console is made of wrought iron, which is not perhaps the best design decision you've ever seen. On the console are [a list of assembly-buttons] and a large white button labelled Start."

The printed name of button-lefthand is "left hand button". The printed name of button-righthand is "right hand button". The printed name of button-leftarm is "left arm button".

The robot-leftarm precedes the robot-lefthand.
The robot-rightarm precedes the robot-righthand.
The robot-leftleg precedes the robot-leftfoot.
The robot-rightleg precedes the robot-rightfoot.
The robot-head precedes the robot-face.

[FIX THIS LATER Make these statements below more exciting]
After an actor pushing an assembly-button (called currentbutton):
	if assembly-scene is not happening:
		say "A harsh buzzing is all that results from these efforts.";
	otherwise:

Section 1 - Basics

A thing can be shootable or not shootable.

A battle-bot is a kind of neuter person. Understand "enemy" or "bot" or "robot" as a battle-bot. A battle-bot is usually shootable.

Section 2 - Basics of programming

A battle-bot has a list of actions called the programming. 
A battle-bot has a list of actions called the temp-programming. 

A battle-bot can be paused or unpaused. A battle-bot is usually paused.

When play begins:
	repeat with currentbot running through battle-bots:
		add currentbot botshooting to programming of currentbot;

When a replayful scene begins:
	repeat with current running through battle-bots in the location:
		now the temp-programming of current is {};
		add the programming of current to temp-programming of current;

Every turn when an unpaused activated battle-bot (called currentbot) is in the location (this is the bot programming rule):
	if a replayful scene was happening:
		repeat with realbot running through unpaused activated battle-bots in the location:
			try entry 1 of temp-programming of realbot;
			rotate temp-programming of realbot;

The robot fighting rule is listed before the bot programming rule in the every turn rulebook.

Instead of a battle-bot (called currentbot) jumping:
	say "[The currentbot] jumps up and down."

Botshooting is an action applying to nothing.

Definition: a thing (called current) is a good-guy:
	if current is the player:

My classmates thought I was a fool for studying the...well, I'm not sure you've learned about that just yet. Either way, I've spent quite a bit of time preparing for this moment.

A woman in white stands, facing away from you towards the window. Her head is crowned with spikes, and you notice that her hand trembles ever so slightly. She slowly turns to look at you

Her face is covered with a white mask. It's the woman from your visions.

'Hello, Emrys. Welcome to your future[delwelcome],' says the woman. 'My name is [Arawn Webster]. There's just one thing that we need to do before we begin.'

She reaches towards your head, and a silver device on her wrist whirrs. To your shock, the recorder you had implanted years ago comes off of your head and into her hand. You frantically run your hand over the area, but your skin is smooth and unaffected.

'Don't worry, you can have the recorder back later. The removal process is quite safe, I assure you. I'm sure you'll see the wisdom of that in a few minutes; the Record is quite long enough as it is. Now, I'm sure that you have many questions. I'm happy to answer them.'

'Because of the technology?' you ask. 'You were able to reverse-engineer everything?'

'That's the blessing part,' she says. 'You set off the largest scientific revolution in centuries. Rift technology, nano-robotics, artificial intelligence, holographic technology, even weapon systems...' she trails off before picking up again. 'But you also shackled us. As we researched time travel, we realized, to our horror, that deviating from the Record might destroy our reality. Since that day, everything we have done has been to ensure that the Record did not deviate. That is the curse. And that's why I asked you to turn off your recorder.

'Almost all of your adventure has been in this timeline, on this ship, 215 years in your future. The only places you've been that weren't in that time frame were the smaller red rifts you created yourself to times in between us. But don't worry, there's a timeline in the museum.'

'So you're a Storyweaver, too,' you point out. 'Are we...?'

'Related? No. As far as I can tell, your descendants remained on earth and are quite ordinary. No, I am just a person, like you. Quite a bit like you, in fact, which I'd like to talk about later. But I've been sending you messages in the other areas. Journal pages, for instance. And hints under the name SpikySpiderSkull.'

'About that, what's up with the skull mask?' you ask.

'Part of it is to preserve anonymity. Part of it is because it is in the Record. But mainly...' She grins. 'I do just like the way it looks.'

'So what's your position, exactly? Scientist? President? Priestess?' you say.

That's why only Storyweavers and specialized robots use the rifts on a regular basis.

It describes the various types of rifts you've become familiar with: black and white rifts resulting from cutting off parts of space, and blue or red rifts caused by sewing them together. The latter two differ only in their stitching, the blue being separated in space and the red being separated in time.

The information in the Record showed that it was possible to make interstellar journeys on a ship where everyone was awake by providing more for them to do. This included entertainment. but also healthy work options.

Entertainment includes zoos, museums, holograms, nature, and special events. Many people even explore the catacombs under the surface using remotely-controlled nanobot avatars. The juxtaposition of dangerous environments with the safety of long-distance control makes for a lot of fun."

In 2340 was the asteroid strike that damaged the Tragwyddol. It was the same year as your time travel and the subsequent arrival of the Record, delivered by you. It was the year of the Tragwyddol's landing on its target planet.

All of these were used in the construction of the Starship Tisserand, which took roughly forty years, involving the gathering of numerous asteroids and comets, as well as production of an atmosphere.

Apparently a group of protesters sprang up at one point that wanted to intentionally deviate from the Record, claiming that it wasn't real and was just an effort by the government to control the people. It looks like several of them were imprisoned, while others eventually changed their minds and were reintegrated into society. At their height, they denied the existence of you, the earth, and the old Starship Tragwyddol.

Near the end of this period, around 2455, there was a massive tech disaster in Central, in which you appeared to Lance Franklin and took some of the results of his work, including a stabilizer. This is also labelled in red."

'Both. I think we're almost there; we already have people like the Webmaster and Curators that have positions of authority.

So, the robots for manual labor are shaped like animals. The monkeys do the fine motor work, deer do transportation. We have quite a few types.'

'That makes sense,' you say.  'But why did they keep stealing things? Is that inherent?'

She laughs, one of the few moments you've seen her relax so far. 'No, we don't program robots to commit crimes in general. The fact is, we needed to motivate you to enter the rifts. And only Storyweavers and robots can interact with the rifts, due to the nature of their radiation.'

'You couldn't just ask me? I'd like to think I would have said yes,' you say.

She turns serious again. 'We couldn't take that risk. I had to construct a narrative that would draw you in, get you interested, committed. It's what we do; we are Storyweavers, after all. And I wove you a story.'"

'Oh time travel, of course,' says the bot, fluttering about nervously. 'Yeah, some humans don't seem to like robots much, but thankfully I've never been threatened. No, some stuff has to--I mean, had to be kept from you until the right time.'

'I...not really. I do more spoken stuff. I'm a Storyweaver,' you say. 'So, I tell stories.'

He glares at you. 'I admit that this group is missing most of the movers and shakers around here, although I do spy our beloved Pilot and her left-hand man Morgan here. But whatever I'm here for, it'll give me a better opportunity to network my growing collection of videos.'

'Hmm,' you say";

'What'd you tell them about Andy?' you ask.

'You know, just normal stuff. Like how he kept me in the dark kitchen for hours. Once he forgot me for three months!'

'Wow. That really sucks,' you say.

'Eh. It's all I've really known,' says Max. 'But it sounds like the same guys wanted to talk to Andy. I wonder what he'll say.'

'Yeah, I wonder,' you say";
	otherwise if currenttarget is party-webmaster:

'Heard of you? Of course, dear! You're the national hero! Although I have to admit, I didn't think that the time travel part was real...'

'What about the others that were with you?' you ask.

She shrugs. 'They may have been invited. I'm not sure. I'm just SO excited to meet you. And our Pilot! And all of these lovely robots. Big fan of robots, I am,' she says.

'Well, I'm glad you're here,' you say";

'Weren't you dressed as a ghost yourself?' you ask.

'Well, yes. I had been waiting months to run that program. I'm really into horror, but I can't handle jumpscares. So this was perfect,' she says. Then she flushes and says, 'Sorry, I'm rambling. I shouldn't be babbling in front of the original Storyweaver!'

'I'm not the original,' you say. 'There were a lot of Storyweavers before me; some were pretty good!'

The tool begins to flash, and Arawn backs away, pulling you with her. Then with a completely silent and still explosion, the largest rift you've ever seen opens in front of you, a red rift with a trail of energy that extends up into the sky. The pedestal lowers again, taking the tool with it.

Arawn looks at you and holds up your recorder in her hand, the one she took from you earlier. 'This is what changed history,' she said. 'This is what matters. It's time to make your choice.

You think through your options. To complete the time loop, one of you will have to put on the recorder and go in. So, like Arawn said, you can either wear the recorder or give it to her. The universe won't care; either way, it will be the same story and spawn the same legends.

[one of]It's immediately clear what is wrong; t[or]T[stopping]he primary containment vessel, the 10 meter tall device that holds the fuel, has broken open, and no water is flowing in to cool it. The fuel inside is partially melted. Standing this close, [our] heart beats uncomfortably fast and [our] head aches[first time][dyingtext][only].

A valve wheel on the very end of the coolant pipe is closed. If the water can be restored through that valve wheel, the reactor can be saved. [unless the streaming-water is nowhere]But, [we] can tell that the coolant pipe is completely empty. Something in the other rooms is blocking the flow[otherwise if the raised-trap is in the location]But there's no way water can get through while the trap is raised[otherwise if the twisted-grill is in the raised-trap][We] can tell that water is in the pipe, but it's getting stuck somewhere in the middle, before it even reaches the valve[otherwise]Water is finally flowing all the way to the closed valve wheel itself.

It describes the reactor [nameus] [if the player is arawn]is[otherwise]are[end if] in as a BWR, or Boiling Water Reactor, running on enriched uranium and using light water (i.e. water without heavy isotopes such as deuterium). There are eight such reactors located near the center of the ship[or][We] [adapt the verb skim] forward until [we] [adapt the verb find] something helpful.

On one page, it says that this reactor functions by pumping water through the primary containment (the area housing the reactor itself), where it becomes heated to the boiling point. That is then pumped away, where it transfers heat to multiple steam generation units that generate electricity. Much of the excess heat is used to warm the living quarters[or][We] [adapt the verb skim] forward until [we] [adapt the verb find] something helpful.

On one page, it says that the reactor has several emergency shutdown systems, including a scram system, in which control rods are held suspended over the fuel rods by electromagnets so that any interruption to the power source can cause the rods to drop. 

However, due to a phenomenon known as decay heat, a reactor can continue to radiate intense heat after a shutdown. Unless the fuel is cooled, a meltdown can occur. This is when the uranium becomes hot enough to melt itself and the surrounding containment structures, spilling into the surrounding area. This would be catastrophic[or]This is the final page.

It gives the shutdown procedures that must be followed before personnel are allowed in the reactor core after an emergency shutdown:

[italic type]1. First, the computer (or its backup) must be turned on and authenticated. In the absence of computer commands, the reactor will fall back on automatic safety systems, including locking the main reactor door.[line break]2. Users without authorization must receive authorization from a senior-level officer using the HAIL button. If no senior officer responds within five minutes, authorization can be given automatically to auxiliary officers. [line break]3. The reactor must be isolated from the rest of the ship. There are four blast shields that can be lowered. Each can be selected by the SHIELD knob. Upon selection, the cameras and PA system in that area will activate, allowing you to warn civilians to leave the area.[line break]4. Once each area is clear, the selected shield can be lowered by pressing the LS button.[line break]5. The door to the reactor core will only open once all four blast shields have been lowered[roman type][cycling]."

'I don't know about any of them,' says Idris, sounding a bit bitter. 'The Captain disappeared early on. Same with Gareth. Sanya was out looking for her dog, and hasn't come back.'

The redux-tube is an closed locked scenery door. The redux-tube is up from Transit-redux and down from broken-bridge.The printed name of the redux-tube is "transport tube". Understand "transport" or "tube" or "elevator" as the redux-tube. The description of the redux-tube is "The tube looks like it's still in working order[if the metal-plate is in the location]. And it's large enough to accommodate [the metal-plate][end if]. It is currently [if the redux-tube is open]open[otherwise]closed[end if] and [if the redux-tube is unlocked]unlocked[otherwise]locked[delimprisoned][end if]." 

To say delimprisoned:
	deliver imprisoned-quip;

Before opening the redux-tube:
	deliver imprisoned-quip;

Before unlocking keylessly the redux-tube:
	deliver imprisoned-quip;
	
Before unlocking the redux-tube with something:
	deliver imprisoned-quip;

Imprisoned-quip is a quip. The printed name of imprisoned-quip is "Imprisoned". Understand "imprisoned" as imprisoned-quip. The target of imprisoned-quip is olgin-redux. The preview of Imprisoned-quip is "Why is the transport tube locked?".

The targetresponse of imprisoned-quip is "Sergeant Olgin shakes her head woefully. 'The bridge is gone, Emrys. Smashed to pieces. Unless you have a way of breathing up there, like an oxygen pack or a helmet, you won't be headed up there. It's a shame, too; I'm sure there are plenty of escape pods up there, with no one to reach them.'

'Can you lend me a helmet?' you ask. 

'They're all in use,' she says. 'Although...' She tilts her head. Her face darkens. 'You may not like it, but I'm getting a report that an officer was downed below us, in the living quarters. If you can reach that helmet before the others get there, you could take it.'

'I don't really like the idea of scavenging from the dead,' you say.

'Every officer that's left is someone who is trying to save the others,' she says. 'That includes saving you. It would honor his memory. Go grab it, and I'll unlock the tube.'".

Report uttering imprisoned-quip to olgin-redux:
	now the deceased-officer is in quarters-redux;
	now the tredux-crowd is nowhere;

Emergency-quip is a quip. Understand "emergency" as emergency-quip. The printed name of emergency-quip is "Emergency". The target of emergency-quip is olgin-redux. The preview of emergency-quip is "Sergeant, what's our status? How can I help?".

The targetresponse of emergency-quip is "Sergeant Olgin says, 'Good to see you, Storyweaver. Our status is red; everyone has to evacuate immediately, or help others evacuate.' 

'As for what you can do,' she adds, looking at your head, 'you need to get to a pod and get out of here. Leave it to us, Emrys.'".

Escapee-quip is a quip. Understand "Escapee" as Escapee-quip. The printed name of Escapee-quip is "Escapee". The target of Escapee-quip is olgin-redux. The preview of Escapee-quip is "Sergeant, there's an escaped prisoner on a rampage!".

Olgin-unlock is a scene. Olgin-unlock begins when the molded-helmet is worn by the player and the player is enclosed by transit-redux.

When olgin-unlock begins:
	say "Olgin notices your helmet and gives you a thumbs up, unlocking the transport tube.";

Section 4 - Living Quarters

Quarters-redux is a room. It is east from posh-redux. It is in finale2-region. The printed name of quarters-redux is "Living Quarters".  "You are just inside the largest residential module on the ship. Usually, this area hosts a few dozen families, each with their own unit opening up into a main atrium. All of the units seem empty, now, though. This area is abandoned. The rest of the ship is to the [boldwest]."

The atrium-redux is scenery in quarters-redux. The printed name of the atrium-redux is "atrium". Understand "residential" or "module" or "atrium" or "stifling" as the atrium-redux. The description of the atrium-redux is "The atrium of the living module doesn't have open air or sunlight. It feels stifling."

The family-dredux are plural-named scenery in quarters-redux. The printed name of the family-dredux is "doors to homes". Understand "families" or "door" or "doors" or "home" or "homes" as the family-dredux.

Instead of unlocking the family-dredux with something:
	say "You have nothing to unlock the doors with."
	
Instead of locking the family-dredux with something:
	say "They are already very locked."

Instead of closing the family-dredux:
	say "They are already very locked."

Instead of entering the family-dredux:
	say "The doors are closed firmly shut."

The deceased-officer is fixed in place. "An officer lies on the ground, deceased[if the molded-helmet is part of the deceased-officer]. He is wearing a helmet capable of supplying oxygen, just like Sergeant Olgin suggested[otherwise]. His face is pale[end if]." Understand "him" or "deceased" or "officer" or "dead" or "body" or "corpse" as the deceased-officer. Understand "pale" or "face" or "eyes" or "closed" or "carl" as the deceased-officer when the molded-helmet is not part of the deceased-officer.

The molded-helmet is part of the deceased-officer. The molded-helmet is a wearable thing. The printed name of the molded-helmet is "molded helmet". Understand "molded" or "clear" or "glass" or "front" or "helmet" as the molded-helmet. The description of the molded-helmet is "The helmet looks like it's right about your size. It is designed for protection, but also has a clear glass front to allow for better sight.".

Instead of removing the molded-helmet from the deceased-officer:
	try taking the molded-helmet;
	
Before taking the molded-helmet when the molded-helmet is part of the deceased-officer:
	now the molded-helmet is in the location;
	
After taking the molded-helmet for the first time:
	say "You gently take off the helmet and see the officer's face. You recognize him; his name was Carl, and he was a late addition to the flight, coming in from a distant asteroid colony. His face is pale.

You are struck by a memory of a conversation you overheard...

[italic type]'So why'd you take this job? I heard you were making bank out in the asteroid fields,' asks a heavy-set security officer, talking to Carl.

Carl shrugs. 'They wanted to put me in a desk job. I told them I wanted to be out in the field, but they just said I was getting [']too old['] for heroics. Figured this job here was my last shot at any excitement. But it turns out...' He pauses, indicating the officers in the lunch room, who were lazing about, watching television or reading their digital pads. 'This gig is the same thing. To me, the starship is just one big office. I just wish I could help someone, you know? I mean, for real. But I guess a life of leisure is all that the universe wants for me, and it's gonna give it to me no matter what I do.'[roman type]

The memory fades.

Looking over the helmet, it looks like it should fit you just fine.";

Every turn when the player is enclosed by transit-redux:
	if the molded-helmet is worn by the player:
		now the redux-tube is open;
		now the redux-tube is unlocked;
	otherwise:
		now the redux-tube is closed;
		now the redux-tube is locked;
		
Chapter 17 - Engineering room

The eng-redux is west from transit-redux. The printed name of eng-redux is "Engineering Room". It is in finale2-region. "The engineering room looks like it has been ransacked. Heavy panels have been pulled out of the floor to provide access to the backup storage [bolddown] below you. You can go [boldeast] out of here."

The storage-area is scenery in eng-redux. The printed name of the storage-area is "storage area". Understand "storage" or "area" or "backup" as the storage-area.

Instead of physicality when the noun is the storage-area:
	say "If you want to do anything with the storage area, you'll have to go [bolddown].";
	
The description of the storage-area is "It's hard to see what's down there."

Section 1 - Rope

[Example 228: Otranto is the source for most of the following code]

A rope is a kind of thing.

Definition: a thing is nonrope if it is not a rope. [The perfect idiocy of this statement notwithstanding, having a shortcut will come in very handy later]

A thing can be ropestuck or not ropestuck. A thing is usually not ropestuck.

Definition: the long-cable is tied if the number of ropestuck things is greater than 1.

Definition: a thing is free if it is not tied.

Definition: a rope is free if the number of ropestuck things is less than 2.

Definition: a thing is hindering if it is ropestuck and it is not enclosed by the location.

A thing can be round or unevenly shaped. A thing is usually round.

Definition: something is anchored:
	if it is the metal-plate, decide no;
	if it is fixed in place, decide yes;
	if it is scenery, decide yes;
	if it is part of an anchored thing, decide yes;
	decide no;

Definition: something is draggable if it is not had by the player and it is not the player and it is not anchored.

[Now, we want a rope to be described in terms of the way it is tied, when it's described in a room description.]

To say athecoil:
	say "[one of][A long-cable][or][The long-cable][stopping]";

To say smathecoil:
	say "[one of][a long-cable][or][the long-cable][stopping]";

Rule for writing a paragraph about a rope (called the coil):

To decide what room is the home of (item - a thing):
	if item is a door:
		decide on the front side of the item;
	decide on the location of the item.

A thing can be ropestuck or not ropestuck. A thing is usually not ropestuck.

Rule for printing the name of eng-space when the player has not been in eng-space:
	say "the storage area below"

Rule for writing a paragraph about a ropestuck thing (called the anchor):
	if the anchor is the big-handle:
		say "A safety handle has been screwed into the floor. ";
	let coil be the long-cable;

You are [if a ropestuck thing is held by the player]also [end if]holding the middle.";
			otherwise:

Rule for writing a paragraph about the ice-hook when the player is in officer-redux:
	say "The grappling hook has become firmly embedded into the top of the cliff. You probably won't be able to get it out again.";
	if the ice-hook is ropestuck:

[We need a way to account for it when it's being carried, as well.]

After printing the name of a rope (called the tied object) while taking inventory:
	if the number of ropestuck things > 0:
		say " (attached to [the list of ropestuck things])";
	otherwise:
		say " (with both ends free)".

[And, indeed, whenever the player examines a rope, we should see what's connected.]

Instead of examining a rope (called the cord) when the number of ropestuck things > 0:
	say "[The noun] is tied to [the list of ropestuck things][if every ropestuck thing is not visible], which is not visible[otherwise if a ropestuck thing is not visible], of which [the list of not visible ropestuck things] [are] not visible[end if]."

[Similarly, any time the player looks at something tied to a rope.]

Report examining the player when the player is ropestuck:
	if the number of ropestuck things > 1:
		say "You're currently lashed to [the list of secondary ropestuck things]."

After examining something which is ropestuck:
	if the number of ropestuck things > 1:
		let temp be a random secondary ropestuck thing;
		say "[The noun] [are] currently attached to [temp] [if temp is not visible](which [are] not currently visible) [end if]via the cable.";
	otherwise:
		say "[The noun] [are] currently attached to the cable."

[We also need to make sure that the rope can be interacted with properly even when it's partly in the next room.]

Finale2time is a truth state that varies. Finale2time is false.
Partyhappening is a truth state that varies. Partyhappening is false.

Every turn (this is the scope adjustment rule):
	if the player is in finale2-region:
		now finale2time is true;
	otherwise:
		now finale2time is false;
	if the player is in party-region:
		now partyhappening is true;
	otherwise:
		now partyhappening is false;

Lastcableroom is a room that varies. Lastcableroom is eng-space.

Every turn when the player is in finale2-region (this is the cablescope rule):
	if a ropestuck thing is visible:
		if the long-cable is not enclosed by the location of the player:
			now lastcableroom is the location of long-cable;
			now the long-cable is in the location of the player;
		otherwise if the long-cable is held by the player:
			now lastcableroom is the location of the player;
	otherwise:
		if the player is in lastcableroom:
			if long-cable is not enclosed by the location:
				now long-cable is in the location;
					
After going when the player is in finale2-region:
	if the player is in lastcableroom:
		if long-cable is not enclosed by the location:
			now long-cable is in the location;
		if a ropestuck thing is visible:
			if the long-cable is not enclosed by the location of the player:
				now lastcableroom is the location of long-cable;
				now the long-cable is in the location of the player;
			otherwise if the long-cable is held by the player:
				now lastcableroom is the location of the player;
	continue the action;

[if something stuck to the long-cable is in the location, place the long-cable in scope]
		
A reaching inside rule:
	if the noun is the long-cable:
		allow access.
		
[Now tying:]

Before tying something to a rope:
	if the noun is ropestuck, say "[The noun] and [the second noun] are already tied together." instead;
	if the second noun is not free, say "[The second noun] has no ends free." instead;
	if the noun is round:
		if the noun is the sharp-cliff:
			say "You can't tie anything to the cliff itself, but if you had a hook, you could throw it at the cliff." instead;
		otherwise:
			say "You can't realistically tie anything to [the noun]." instead.

Instead of tying a rope to something:
	try tying the second noun to the noun.

Instead of tying something to a rope:
	now the noun is ropestuck;
	say "You loop [the second noun] around [the noun] and knot firmly."

Instead of tying something to a nonrope tied thing:
	let the coil be the long-cable;
	try tying the noun to the coil.

Instead of tying a nonrope tied thing to something:
	let the coil be the long-cable;
	try tying the second noun to the coil.

Instead of tying a free nonrope thing to a free nonrope thing when the player is in finale2-region:
	if the player carries a free rope (called the coil):
		try tying the noun to the coil;
		if the noun is ropestuck and the coil is free:
			try tying the second noun to the coil;
	otherwise:
		say "You lack the requisite spare cable."

Understand "untie [something] from [something]" as untying it from when the player is in finale2-region. Understand "untie [something]" as untying it from when the player is in finale2-region.

Understand "detach [something] from [something]" as untying it from when the player is in finale2-region. Understand "detach [something]" as untying it from when the player is in finale2-region.

Understand "disconnect [something] from [something]" as untying it from when the player is in finale2-region. Understand "disconnect [something]" as untying it from when the player is in finale2-region.

Understand "unfasten [something] from [something]" as untying it from when the player is in finale2-region. Understand "unfasten [something]" as untying it from when the player is in finale2-region.

Rule for supplying a missing second noun while untying something from:
	let L be a list of things;
	let M be a list of things;
	repeat with current running through unevenly shaped things:
		if current is ropestuck:
			if current is secondary:
				add current to L;
			if current is touchable:
				if current is nonrope:
					add current to M;
	if the noun is ropestuck:
		add long-cable to L;
	if the number of entries in L is  0, say "[The noun] is already entirely free." instead;
	if the noun is a rope:
		if the number of entries in M > 1:
			say "You'll have to say which thing you want to untie [the noun] from.";
			rule fails;
		otherwise:
			if the number of entries in M is 0, say "You can't reach [the random ropestuck thing]." instead;
			sort M in random order;
			let the tied object be entry 1 of M;
			say "(from [the tied object])[line break]";
			now the second noun is the tied object;
	otherwise:
		if the noun is ropestuck:
			say "(from [the long-cable])[line break]";
			now the second noun is the long-cable.

Untying it from is an action applying to two things.

Before untying a rope from something: try untying the second noun from the noun instead.

Before untying something from a rope:
	if the second noun is not held:
		say "(first picking up [the second noun])[line break]";
		try taking the second noun.

Check untying it from:
	unless (the noun is ropestuck and the second noun is the long-cable) or (the second noun is ropestuck and the noun is the long-cable):
		say "[The noun] and [the second noun] are already not tied together." instead.

Carry out untying it from:
	now the noun is not ropestuck;
	now the second noun is not ropestuck;

Report untying it from:
	say "You untie [the noun] and [the second noun]."

[Another part of the fun of a rope is that you can drag things from another room:]

After taking the long-cable:
	say "You gather up the slack of the cable."
	
Understand "slack" as the long-cable.

Does the player mean tying something to the all-recorder:
	it is unlikely;

Before pulling something anchored when the player is in finale2-region: say "[The noun] is firmly anchored." instead.

Instead of pulling a tied long-cable:
	if the noun is unmentioned:
		say "The impulse is transmitted to [the list of pullable ropestuck things].[paragraph break]";
		repeat with item running through pullable ropestuck things:
			say "[item][if item is not visible] (out of sight)[end if]: [run paragraph on]";
			try pulling the item;
		if the noun is a rope and the noun is not within the location:
			if the number of nonrope hindering things is 0, move the noun to the location;
			now lastcableroom is the location;
	otherwise:
		continue the action.

Instead of pulling a ropestuck thing:
	let L be the list of secondary ropestuck things;
	add the long-cable to L;
	if the noun is unmentioned:
		say "The impulse is transmitted to [the L].[paragraph break]";
		repeat with item running through L:
			say "[item][if item is not visible] (out of sight)[end if]: [run paragraph on]";
			try pulling the item;
		if the noun is a rope and the noun is not within the location:
			if the number of nonrope hindering things is 0, move the noun to the location;
		if the number of ropestuck things in the location > 1:
			now lastcableroom is the location;
	otherwise:
		continue the action.

Before pulling something which is not visible:
	if the noun is anchored:
		say "[The noun] resists, for whatever reason." instead;
	otherwise:
		let space be the holder of the noun;
		repeat with way running through directions:
			if the room way of space is the location:
				move the noun to the location;
				say "[The noun] [if the way is up]rises[otherwise]slides[end if] into view." instead;
		move the noun to the location;
		now lastcableroom is the location;
		say "[The noun] slides into view." instead.

Definition: a thing is secondary if it is not the noun.  Definition: a thing is pullable if it is not the noun and it is not the player.

[A player who is tied to things should also have some restrictions on his ability to move.]

Report looking when the player is in finale2-region:

'But shouldn't you be trying to escape?' you ask.

'Emrys,' he says, looking at you seriously. 'There's one me. There are thousands of them. The math is simple. If I wanted to leave, I would have; most of the crew already have. I'll leave once I know there isn't a single thing I can do anymore.'".

'I know,' you say. 'But it's my only way off the ship.'

'What about the pods in the living quarters?' he asks. He points to the wounded and to the bloodstained curtain beyond them. 'None of these people are getting off the ship. There should be a ton of extra pods.'

He paces back and forth a bit, and says, 'You know what? I'll do it. But only if you help me.'

'How?' you ask. 'Do you want me to help you to a pod?'

'No,' he says. 'I've made my choice. I'm going to honor our dead, give them a Viking funeral. I want you to help me help the dead. Two officers were brought in after the bridge collapse: officers Mefe and Rhys. Find something for each of them, one of their possessions, and I'll find you the key.'

Thinking back, there were some parts of the bridge you hadn't explored; they hadn't looked important at the time.

You watch the Starship Tragwyddol slowly get smaller and smaller. There is a bright flash from part of the ship, and almost all of the lights go out. You see a few more escape pods make their way out, as well as one large cargo container. Maybe Idris got his viking funeral after all.

You are adrift in space. The air hisses as the cryogenic process begins. It'll take several minutes, so you look out into space.  The empty sky is lit up by the lights of hundreds of escape pods. A lot of people made it; thank heavens. But so many have been lost...

There is a crackling sound, and you hear a voice come over your recorder. 

'Emrys? Are you there?'

'Gareth?' you ask, feeling relief flood over you.

'Yeah, it's me. I'm so glad you answered; I've been trying you every few minutes since I got out.'

'So you're okay?' you ask.

'As okay as I can be. My cryo has almost kicked in, so I don't have long,' he says. You can hear the hiss in the background.

'Mine, too,' you say. 

'I guess I'll see you on the other side, then,' he says.

'I guess you will. See you soon.'

'See you soon.'

The voice fades, and soon everything else begins to fade as well into a white haze as the cryogenic gas fills the chamber. You don't know what will happen next. But you are alive. And your fate is your own.";

[[From code by otistdog]

After deciding the scope of the player while examining (this is the place the room in scope while looking rule): [limits applicability to when parsing examining action]
	place the location in scope, but not its contents. [everything else should already be in scope if applicable]

Does the player mean doing anything to the location: [still prioritizes examination of things vs rooms]
	it is unlikely.

Instead of examining a room:
	try looking instead.]

Part 3 - Stuff that has to be at the end because it won't compile right otherwise

Singlequipping is freeacting. ragequitting is freeacting. spelling is freeacting. crying is freeacting. Singing is freeacting. Talking to is freeacting. Topicing is freeacting.

Shouting is useless action. Swimming is useless action. xyzzying is useless action. Crying is useless action. Dancing is useless action. Digging is useless action. Thingexiting is useless action. 

Book 2 - Endgame text

Section 1 - Procedure

Table of Final Question Options (continued)
final question wording	only if victorious	topic	final response rule	final response activity
"REVEAL the inspiration for the dimensions"	true	"reveal"	investigate something rule	--

This is the investigate something rule:
	say "The Haunted House dimension was the first completed. It was intended to be a classic-style text adventure with traditional puzzles. It was inspired by Garry Francis's style of retro game authoring. Many of the monsters in the game are part of Terraria as well. Frankenstein's lair contains all of the treasures from the game Adventure, which was the earliest text adventure that has remained influential since its creation.

The Murder Mystery dimension was a callback to my game Color the Truth. Both games feature four suspects, a clue system that lets you combine clues, and flashbacks that let you inhabit a character in the past. The courier's story is based on my time living in the Bronx in the early 2000[']s; the author's story is based on my experience with authors being much poorer than the public perceives; the attendant's story is based on compulsive liars, if anything; and the professor's story is unfortunately based on many experiences in academia.

The Wax Museum escape room dimension was inspired by vague memories of a wax museum area in The Mulldoon Legacy. Many of the characters are in the game Civilization, while I first met Diaochan in games like Bandit Kings of Ancient China and Dynasty Warrior. The rooms are loosely themed around the seven deadly sins. Fishblade was a character invented to serve as a 'futuristic' celebrity, and is named after an obscure twitter mini-trend about a theoretical TTRPG called Fishblade. The hideous contraption was directly inspired by the purple room in Mike Sousa's The Recruit. ";
	say "[paragraph break]The Magical Spells Horror dimension was themed on the fourteen fears described in the Magnus Archives podcast. I reached out to Chandler Groover and Amanda Walker for tips on writing horror. The spell system is directly designed to mimic Enchanter, except you can't cast scrolls before inscribing them into the book, as it could place the game in an unwinnable state.

The combat dimension was inspired by Gun Mute, Attack of the Yeti Robot Zombies, and by the sections on persuasion in the Inform 7 manual. Very large chunks of code were taken from the Under Contract example in the manual. The character Max is named after a beta tester. The other was originally Sam, but I forgot that Max and Sam already exists, so it was changed to Dan. Short names were chosen due to the frequent need to type their name before commands.

The cabin and forest dimension was inspired by games like She's Got a Thing for a Spring, Muse, and Sunset Over Savannah, with nature-based exploration and wonder. The crafting mechanics were inspired by Stardew Valley. Originally the concept for this dimension was a plant-based dimension in a magical garden where plants solved every puzzle, but it eventually became a grounded-in-reality dimension. I added journal pages since collecting journal pages is something many games have but which I've never tried. It also provided a way to add backstory to the main NPC of the game. The rock compartment was based on the one Joseph Smith found the Book of Mormon in.

The animals dimension was at first inspired by educational cartoon maps showing every biome next to each other. At the time of writing it is a bit of a meme to see those maps and say 'I want to live there'. At one point I ran out of puzzle ideas, so I themed each puzzle off a different Lord of the Rings character. Most of those got transformed into something very different, so they're no longer recognizable (for instance, the owl's drone piece would be up high and need to be knocked down by a projectile. I realized I'd prefer an animal-based solution, and so switched it to the cougar). ";
	say "[paragraph break]The World Monuments sections was inspired by the many mathematical and physics examples in Inform documentation, including Concentration 1 and 2, Nickle and Dimed, the Cow Exonerated, In Fire or In Flood, and Exonerated. This came after I had completed reading the whole Inform manual and felt bummed at how many awesome examples never (as far as I can tell) got used in games. The idea of descending through a void on a rope came from the Doctor Who episode Impossible Planet.

The Tool dimension was originally designed to provide an extra hurdle for players to overcome in every level, so that players would need to explore more. There would be a tool that would get powers as time went on. I just couldn't figure out what to put in this level or what powers to use. I eventually decided to make it a limited parser room using computer commands for the limitations. I looked to Arthur Dibianca and Monument Valley for inspiration. But I eventually moved away from the limited parser and used this level to give more backstory to the game and to form the backbone or spine of everything. Portal was a bit of an inspiration as well, as well as a game by Doug Egan I tested. The tool is definitely modelled on the sonic screwdriver from Dr Who.

The opening and endgame were written at the same time. The reception hall for Arawn Webster was inspired by the Oval Office, temples of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and vague memories of the Hyatt Regency Orlando Airport. The first two endings were intended to use bits of puzzles from the earlier areas, and were also inspired by The Wrath of Khan and the meltdowns at Three Mile Island and Fukushima. The intro was inspired by 9:05 (answering a call, basic actions like opening doors), and The Art of Misdirection and Hanon Ondricek's game Fair for their scenes 'on stage'.";

Part 4 - Temporary beta-testing stuff

Chapter 1 - Sergeant Olgin

[This isn't temporary. Just leaving it here in case people need it]

Sergeant Olgin is a talkative woman in Transit-room. "Sergeant Olgin is directing the rescue and repair effort in this sector of the starship[deliverexplanation]." The description of Sergeant Olgin is "Sergeant Olgin is a short woman with black hair tied up in a bun, wearing a beige military uniform." 

Understand "short" or "woman" or "earpiece" as Sergeant Olgin.

The olgin-bun is part of sergeant olgin. Understand "black" or "hair" or "bun" as the olgin-bun. The printed name of the olgin-bun is "hair bun". The description of the olgin-bun is "You don't know how Sergeant Olgin does it, but her hair bun is always impeccable, every hair exactly in place."

The beige-uniform is worn by Sergeant Olgin. The printed name of the beige-uniform is "beige uniform". Understand "beige" or "uniform" or "fabric" or "sturdy" or "convertible" or "spacesuit" or "suit" or "space suit" as the beige-uniform. The description of the beige-uniform is "The Sergeant's uniform is made of sturdy beige fabric, and is designed to be easily convertible into a spacesuit in case of hull breach."

To say deliverexplanation:
	deliver reporting-quip;
	
Reporting-quip is a quip. The printed name of Reporting-quip is "Reporting". Understand "Reporting" as reporting-quip. The preview of reporting-quip is "Reporting for duty! How can I help?" The target of reporting-quip is Sergeant Olgin.

The targetresponse of reporting-quip is "'Storyweaver! It's good to see you. We could use more steady people. Right now, we're focusing on getting civilians out; if you find anyone that needs help, help.'

'Got it,' you say.

'Good luck!' she says, and salutes you."

Understand "salute" as waving hands.

Before waving hands in the presence of a person (called onlooker) in ship-region:
	if the noun is not little-girl:
		say "[The onlooker] nods in recognition of your salute.";

[italic type][one of]You see the woman in the skull mask from earlier. She's staring at you, her eyes hard.

'If everything goes according to plan, Emrys Tisserand will die tonight,' says the woman.

That's when you realize you're looking at a mirror.[or]You see the woman in white again. She stands next to a dark river where a robed ferryman stands.

'A Storyweaver will come to you tonight. Make sure that she pays,' says the woman.[or]You are in a dark place underground. The woman in the spiked skull mask is speaking to a hideous spider beast.

The spider talks, its voice grotesque. 'Should I go easy on her?'

The woman shakes her head. 'Our path is already chosen for us.'[or]You see the masked woman carrying a strange cylindrical device. Standing between a cabin and a forest, she presses a button. All the trees quake as the air in front of her ripples. Then the air rips open, forming a red rift in space.[or]You see the masked woman sitting at a desk, speaking to someone you can't see. 

'She's going to have to make a choice,' says the woman.

A man's voice answers. 'Are you sure that you want to leave that up to her?'[or]You see the woman in white from behind. She is crouched down, the large spikes of her mask clearly visible. Surrounding her are several robotic monkeys. She programs them one at a time.[or]You see the masked woman again, seated at a desk again. 

'I see her sometimes, you know,' she says.

'On the Record?' asks a man's voice.

'No,' she says, massaging her eyes through the mask. 'I see her in my mind. It's my Weaver's gift. I can see what she's doing...or will do. Or has done. It can be confusing.'

'Well, that fits what we know from the Record, doesn't it?'[or]You see the woman in the white skull mask pacing furiously, holding a shovel.

A man's voice says, 'I don't understand why you are so upset.'

She throws down the shovel. 'Because she wasn't supposed to be there! It's not in the Record.'

'You told me the Record is incomplete.'

'I--I know,' she says, sitting on a couch. Her voice softens. 'But...her recorder malfunctions. The Yang Engine malfunctions at the same time. It's not a coincidence.'

'Maybe it was meant to be,' he says.

'Don't you see why I'm upset?' she answers. 'If it's meant to be...then did anything I do matter? My sacrifices?'

'They matter to our people. They matter to me. And we have to be sure. Isn't that what you said?'[or]'She's almost here,' says the woman in the white skull mask. 

'Where are you going to meet her? At the garden?' asks a man you cannot see.

'No, I have to ease her in. I'll see her here, in the Pilot's Office.'

'Will I see her?' he asks.

'Yes, we'll have a gathering. A party, if you will. I'd like you to be there.'

'Very well. Good luck, Arawn.'

'Thanks, Morgan.'[stopping][roman type][line break]You come back to yourself, the vision over"
